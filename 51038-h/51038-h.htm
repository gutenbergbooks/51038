<p>Every effort has been made to produce this eBook as close to the
original as possible.</p>
<p>The Greek passages were very to hard to read, and every effort has been made
to reproduce them correctly.</p>
<p>The original book was printed in an Old English Black Letter type-face. The emphasized text
was printed in a normal but slightly smaller font, often italicised as well. In this eBook,
in order to make the book more readable and to maintain the emphasized words, I have adopted
a normal type-face for the main body of text and used a bold type-face, italicised as required.<br /></p>

Eing desirous (gentle Reader)
to exercise my selfe with some
translation, at vacant times, and
seeing, that since the Gospell
hath been preached, this one
question, touching the appearing
of spirits and soules departed, hath not bin
much handled amongst vs, and therfore many,
otherwise well affected in religion vtterly ignorant
heerein, I thought it not amisse to take in
hand some good and learned Treatise concerning
this matter. Wherein as many haue both
learnedly, painfully, and religiously trauelled:
so amongst others, none in my iudgement hath
more handsomly &amp; eloqu&#275;tly, with more iudgment
&amp; better method discoursed the same, th&#275;
<b><i>Lewes Lauaterus</i></b>, Minister of Tigurine. Others
haue h&#257;dled it indeed wel, but yet <i>Nihil ad nostr&#257;
hunc</i>, being either too short, or too long, or too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
darke, or too doubtful, or otherwise so c&#333;fused,
that they leaue the Reader more in suspence in
the end, then they found him in the beginning.
As for Maister <i>Lauaterus</i> his discretion heerein, I
will no otherwise commend it, then to desire
the Reader to view, and iudge himself. For thus
much at the first sight he shall see: A cleare methode,
with a familiar and easie stile, the matter
throughly handled <i>Pro</i> and <i>Con</i>, on both sides,
so that nothing seemeth to be wanting, nor any
thing redounding. And if it be true that Horace
saith, <i>Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit vtile dulci</i>, that
is, He winneth the prize, that ioyneth pleasure
with profit: I thinke this Authour may also in
this respect be pronounced <i>Victor</i>, and adiudged
to the best game. For he so intreateth this serious
and terrible matter of Spirits, that he now
and th&#275; inserting some strange story of Monks,
Priestes, Friers, and such like counterfeits, doth
both very liuely display their falshood, and also
not a litle recreate his Reader: and yet in the end
he so aptly concludeth to the purpose, that his
histories seeme not idle tales, or impertinent vagaries,
but very truthes, naturally falling vnder
the compasse of this matter. And how profitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
this his woorke is, those may best iudge,
which are most ignorant in this question, some
thinking euery small motion &amp; noyse to be Spirites,
and some so fondly perswaded that there
are no Spirits, who being better enformed herein
by this Authour, I suppose will confesse his
work to haue done them some profit: if knowledge
be profitable, and ignorance discommodious.
And againe, those which being hitherto
borne in hande that mens soules returne againe
on earth, crauing helpe of the liuing, and haue
spent much of their substaunce on idle Monkes
and Friers, to relieue them, will confesse the like.
For when they shall see they haue bene falsely
taught, and that they were not the soules of men
which appeared, but either falshood of Monks,
or illusions of diuels, franticke imaginations, or
some other friuolous &amp; vaine perswasions, they
will thinke it profitable to haue knowne the
truth, as well to auoid error hereafter, as to saue
their mony from such greedy caterpillers. Some
also which be otherwise well trained vp in Religion,
and yet not knowing what to thinke of
these matters, will not iudge their labour euill
imployed, nor the worke vnprofitable, wherby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
they may be brought out of doubt, and know
certainly what to beleeue. There be many also
euen now a dayes, which are hanted &amp; troubled
with spirites, and know not howe to vse themselues,
who when they shall learne how a Christian
man ought to gouern himselfe, being vexed
with euil spirits, wil think it a very profitable
point of doctrine, that shal teach them to direct
themselues. Profitable therefore it is, and shalbe,
no doubt, vnto many, and disprofitable vnto
none, except perchance vnto popish Monks and
Priests, who are like hereby to lose a great part
of their gaines, which sometimes they gathered
togither in great abundaunce, by their deceitfull
doctrine of the appearing of dead mens soules.
But this their wicked and diuellish doctrine, togither
with all the patches and appendices therto
belonging, he so notably teareth and cutteth
in peeces, that I am well assured they shal neuer
be able to cobble and clout them vp again. And
this doth he with such a moderation of breuitie
and tediousnesse, that I may rightly say; He hath
said well, and not too much, and written truly,
and not too litle.</p>

<p>Now as touching my translation, although I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
haue not made him speake with like grace in
English, as hee dooth in Latine: yet haue I not
chaunged his meaning, nor altered his matter,
endeuouring my selfe rather to make thee vnderstand
what thou readest, then to smoothe
and pollish it with fine &amp; picked words, which
I graunt others might haue done more exquisitely,
and perchaunce I my selfe also somewhat
better, if I would haue made thereof a study and
labour, and not a recreation and exercise. But
howsoeuer I haue done herein, verily good reader,
I trust thou wilt take in good part, which is
all that I esteeme: if any man shall mislike therof,
let him amend it. I trust it be sufficient to testifie
my good will to do thee good, and to let
thee vnderstand the Authours meaning.</p>

Any and diuers things are reasoned
vpon, both of the learned and
vnlearned, as wel of other matter,
as also of Spirites, which are seene
and heard, and make men afraid in
the night season, and in the day
time, by sea and by lande, in the
fields, woods, and houses: And likewise concerning
such straunge things which for the most part happen
before the death of certain men, especially great
Princes, and before notable innouations of Kingdomes
and Empires. Many which neuer sawe or
heard any of these things, suppose all that is reported
of them, to be meere trifles and old wiues tales:
for so much as simple men, and such as are fearefull
and superstitious, perswade themselues they haue
seen this or that, when indeed the matter is farre otherwise.
Againe, there are some, which assoone as
they heare of any thing, especially if it happen in
the night, they by and by thinke some spirite dooth
walke, and are maruellously troubled in minde, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
they cannot discerne naturall things from spirites.
And some (chiefly those whiche hunt after
gaines, by the soules of dead men) affirme that the
most part of such things which are heard or seene,
are the soules of dead men, which craue helpe of
them that are liuing, to be deliuered out of the torments
of most cruell paine in Purgatorie. Many not
only of the common sort, but also men of excellent
knowledge, do maruell whether there be any spirits
or no, and what maner of things they are. Yea and
some of my familiar friends haue many times requested
me, to shew them my opinion concerning these
matters. Wherfore me seemeth it shall be worth my
laboure, if I declare briefly and plainly out of the
word of God, what we ought to iudge concerning
these things. For the Ministers of Gods Church can
take nothing more profitable in hande, than to instruct
the people of God purely and plainly, in such
necessary matters as come in question out of the
word of God, which is a lanterne (as the Psalmist
saith) vnto our feete, and a light vnto our pathes:
and to deliuer them from all errour and superstition,
and bring them out of all wauering and doubt. And
verily their studie &amp; diligence is to be highly commended,
who for these fewe yeares ago, haue set
forth certaine bookes drawne out of the scriptures,
written in the Germaine tongue against sundrie errours:
and theirs likewise who in these our dayes
by writing of bookes do teache, instruct, and confirme
the rude and vnlearned people. For amongst
many other excellent benefits, which God our heauenly
Father hath bestowed vppon mankinde, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
also is a great and most liberall gift, that in this latter,
and as it were old age of the world, he hath brought
to light by the Art of Imprinting, aswel many other
good Authours, as also the holie scriptures of the
old and new Testament, written in diuers languages:
whereby he doth not onlie teach vs amply and
fully what to beleeue, and what to doo, but also
mightily subuerteth and quite ouerthroweth diuers
and sundrie errours, which by little and little
haue crept into the Church. Truly all such are verie
vngrateful towards God, which do not willingly
acknowledge this so notable a benefit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The diuision
or partes of
this booke.</div>

<p>As touching this my treatise concerning Spirits,
and straunge wonders, I haue deuided it into three
partes for the more cleare vnderstanding therof. In
the first parte I shewe, that there are visions and spirits,
and that they appeare vnto men sometimes, and
that many &amp; maruellous things happen besides the
ordinarie course of nature. In the second I discusse
what maner of things they are, that, is not the soules
of dead men, as some men haue thought, but either
good or euill angels, or else some secret and hid operations
of God. In the third I declare why God doth
somtime suffer Spirits to appear, and diuers forewarnings
to happen: and also how m&#275; ought to behaue
themselues when they happen to meete with such
things. In these points or partes, the chiefest thing
wheron men vse to reason touching this matter, are
conteined. Now I mean to handle this matter, being
very obscure and intricate, with many questions, (I
trust) so plainly, &amp; clerely out of the holy scriptures,
whereon we may surely stay our selues, out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
anci&#275;t fathers, allowed historiographers, and other
good writers, that those which are studious and louers
of Gods truth, may well vnderstand what may
be denied &amp; thought of those apparitions, &amp; other
straunge &amp; maruellous matters. And I also trust that
euen our aduersaries also, (in case they wil lay their
affections aside, but a litle while) wil say that I haue
truly alleaged all their arguments, and confuted th&#275;
without any railing or bitternesse. For my purposed
ende is according to the doctrine of Saint <i>Paule</i>, to
edifie and not to destroy.</p>

<p>As touching diuinations, blessings, iuglings, coniurings,
and diuers kinds of sorcerie, and generally
of all other diuellish practises, certaine learned men
of our time haue written bookes, as <i>Gasper Pencerus</i>,
<i>Ioannes Viera</i>, <i>Ludouicus Mellichius</i>, and perchaunce
some others also, whose worke I haue not yet seene.
It is not long ago since <i>Ioannes Riuius</i> a man learned
and eloquent, published a booke in the latin toong,
entreating of spirites and superstition. In the which
booke albeit very briefly, yet doth hee as he is wont
in all things, very finely &amp; eloquently intreat of this
matter, and of other foolishe superstitions. And albeit
that I do write more largely of this, yet was it not
my minde to gather togither al those thinges which
I could haue spoken and alleaged touching the same
matter: but only such as seeme the chiefest and most
especiall points, partly because I would not be tedious
to the reader, &amp; partly also least my books shuld
grow vnto an ouer great quantity. I haue great hope
that <i>Ioachimus Camerarius</i>, that excellent man, who
readeth the auncient writers both greeks and latins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
with exquisite iudgem&#275;t, and hath great experience
in all things, will shortly write learnedly &amp; at large
of this matter, and also of others like vnto it. For
so muche hee seemeth to promise in his preface to
<i>Plutarches</i> Booke, <i>De defectu oraculorum, &amp; figura,
&amp; consecrata Delphis</i> (wherin he handleth the nature
and operati&#333;s of diuels) and also in other of his writings.
I for my parte had once written this my treatise
in the vulger tong, and now bicause I trust it shal
be also profitable to other men, I haue translated it
into latin, adding certaine things thereto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dedication.</div>

<p>This my booke which I haue with great labour
and study gathered out of other m&#275;s writings I present
&amp; offer vnto you (most noble consul) according
to the ancient fashion &amp; custome: not for that I suppose
you haue any neede of my teaching, touching
these things which are herein h&#257;dled. (For I am not
ignoraunt, vnder what teachers you haue atteined
vnto true learning, and how you haue and do continually
read ouer sundry good authors with perfect
knowledge in many tongues.) But partly that
I might purchase credit and authoritie vnto this my
booke with those men, vnto whome your goodnes,
godlinesse and constancie (which you haue alwaies
hitherto euermore shewed, and yet do shewe, in setting
forth true religi&#333;, &amp; mainteining good lawes)
is throughly knowne: and partly that I might shew
my selfe in some respecte thankfull vnto you. For
your honour hath bestowed many benefits on me,
whom you onlie knowe by sight, and vppon other
Ministers of the Church, wherby ye haue so bound
me vnto you, that I shall neuer be able to make any
recompence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherefore I most earnestly beseech you, not to
refuse this signe and token of my good wil, be it neuer
so simple: but rather to vouchsafe, wh&#275; ye haue
leisure from the laboure and toile of the common
wealth, to reade ouer this my booke: for I haue
good hope it will not seeme vnpleasaunt vnto you
&amp; others in the reading, as wel for the plaine order
I vse therin, as also for the sundrie and manifold histories
in it recited.</p>

<p>Almightie God, who hath so blessed you with
his heauenly gifts, that for them, (albeit very yong)
you haue aspired vnto the highest degree in your
noble citie and domini&#333; of <i>Berna</i>, vouchsafe to preserue
you in health, and increase and multiply his
good gifts in you. My Lords &amp; brethren the ministers
of <i>Tigurin</i>, and also your old companion master
<i>George Grebelius</i>, that excellent man in lerning, vertu,
and nobilitie, hartily salute your Lordship. From
<i>Tigurin</i> in the month of Ianuary, the year of Christs
Natiuitie. 1570.</p>

O the intent, that those men which occupie
themselues in reading of this my
Booke, and especially in perusing of other
auncient writers, may the better
vnderstand euery thing, I will at the
first enteraunce briefly expounde those
things which shall s&eacute;eme to concern the
proprietie of words and termes vsed in
this my Treatise of Spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spectrum</div>

<p><b><i>Spectrum</i></b>, amongst the Latines doth signifie a shape or
forme of some thing presenting it selfe vnto our sight.</p>

<p><b>Scaliger</b> affirmeth, that <b><i>Spectrum</i></b> is a thing which offereth
it selfe to be s&eacute;ene, either truly, or by vaine imagination.
The Diuines take it to be a substance without a bodie,
which being heard or s&eacute;ene, maketh men afraide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visum.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>Visum</i></b>, signifieth an imagination or a certaine shewe,
which men being in sl&eacute;epe, yea and waking also, s&eacute;eme in
their iudgement to behold: as we read of Brutus, who saw
his owne angell. <b>Cicero</b> in his first booke Acadæm, quest.
writeth, that <b><i>Visum</i></b>, amongst the Grecians is called
<span class="gktext">&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;</span>,
a fantasie, or vaine imagination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visio.</div>

<p>Also the Latines call those things <b><i>Visiones</i></b>, which the

Grecians name <span class="gktext">&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terriculamenta.</div>

<p><b><i>Terriculamenta</i></b>, are vain visions or sights, which make
men afraide. The Latines also call it <b><i>Terriculum</i></b>, because it
br&eacute;edeth feare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Phantasma.</div>

<b><i>Phantasma</i></b> and <b><i>Phantasia</i></b>, saying, that <b><i>Phantasma</i></b>
is an imagination, an appearance or sight of a thing which is not, as
are those sightes which men in their sl&eacute;epe do thinke they
s&eacute;e: but that <b><i>Phantasia</i></b>, is the s&eacute;eing of that onely which is in

The Gentiles (as S. Augustine and other Fathers
doo testifie) supposed that the soules of men became
<b><i>Dæmones</i></b>, that is, good or euil angels: which if they had done
well, then were they called <b><i>Lares</i></b>, that is priuate gods:
but if they haue done euill, then were they named <b><i>Lemures</i></b>,
or <b><i>Larue</i></b>, bugs and Elues. But if it were doubted whether
they had liued well or ill, then were they called <b><i>Manes</i></b>.
Apuleius and other old writers affirme, that <b><i>Genij</i></b> and
<b><i>Lares</i></b> were all one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lares.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Præstites.</div>

<p>It was supposed (as <b>Festus</b> witnesseth) that <b><i>Lares</i></b>, were
the soules of men, or else infernall gods. <b><i>Lares</i></b> were called
<b><i>Præstites</i></b>, because they made all things safe with their eies:

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

that is, they saued and preserued all things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hostilij.</div>

<p>And Authors affirme, they were called <b><i>Hostilij</i></b>, for that they were
supposed to driue away enemies. Neither were they thought to beare rule
only in priuate houses, &amp; in crosse m&eacute;eting waies, but also to defend
Cities. They were likewise worshipped priuately in houses, and openly
in the high wayes. As touching those that were called <b><i>Lares</i></b>, you
may read more in Anthonius Constantius, of Fauentia his
Commentaries, and in Ouid.lib.5.Fastorum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genius.</div>

<p><b><i>Genius</i></b> (say the Grammarians) is the naturall god of euery place, of
euery thing, or of euery man when we are borne, as it is written, we
haue two <b><i>Genij</i></b>, whereof the one encourageth vs to doo well, the other
to doo euill. <b><i>Genius</i></b> (saith <b>Censorinus</b>) is a god in whose
gouernance euery man doth liue, so soone as he is borne: either because
h&eacute;e taketh care for our begetting, or that he is engendred with vs, or
else that he taketh charge and defence of vs when we are begotten. Sure
it is, he is called <b><i>Genius, à gignendo</i></b>, that is, of begetting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Penates</div>

<p><b><i>Penates</i></b> likewise are domesticall gods. <b>Macrobius</b> affirmeth,
that they are gods by whom we onely breathe, by
whom we enioy this body, and by whom we possesse the reason
of our mindes. <b>Nonius</b> saith, <b><i>Lemures</i></b> are spirites walking
by night, and terrors rising of pictures of m&#275; &amp; beasts.
Other say, that <b><i>Lemures</i></b> are euil and hurtfull shapes which
appeare in the night, yea and that they be the soules of those
that make men black and blew, called after that name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vmbræ.</div>

<p>Some men call the ghosts of all dead things by y&#868; name
of <b><i>Lemures</i></b>. Thus saith <b>Apuleius</b>, Of those <b><i>Lemures</i></b>, he
that hath care of his posteritie, and inhabiteth the house
with a peaceable and quiet kinde of rule, was called <b><i>Lar
familiaris</i></b>, god of the house. And be cause among the people
of olde time, as they counted <b><i>Lares</i></b> good, so they supposed
<b><i>Lemures</i></b> to be naught, therefore to driue them away, they
did sacrifice vnto them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lemures.</div>

<p>Some other affirme, that <b><i>Lemures</i></b> are soules which
tarry about the bodies. <b>Porphyrius</b> calleth them the wandring
soules of men departed before their time, as it were <b><i>Remures</i></b>,
taking their name of <b>Remus</b>, whose soule folowed
his brother <b>Romulus</b>: who to the intent he might pacifie
them, instituted feastes called <b><i>Lemuria</i></b>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laruæ.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ceriti.</div>

<p><b>Seruius</b> writeth, that <b><i>Vmbræ</i></b> were called <b>L<i>aruæ</i></b>: and
they called dead mens soules by the name of <b>V<i>mbræ</i></b>. Of
<b>L<i>aruæ</i></b> men are called <b>L<i>aruati</i></b>, that is to say, frantike men,
and such as are vexed with spirits. Who also as (<b>Nonius</b>
witnesseth) are called <b><i>Ceriti</i></b>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manes.</div>

<p><b>Seruius</b> saith, that mennes soules are called <b><i>Manes</i></b>,
at suche time as departing from their bodies, they are
not yet passed into other bodies. And he iudgeth that they
are so called by the figure <span class="gktext">&#7937;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&phi;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
(whiche is when one speaketh by contraries) of the olde adiectiue <b><i>Manus</i></b>, that
is good, because they were nothing lesse than good. For
the auncient people supposed, that <b><i>Manes</i></b> were infernall
gods, and therefore did they number them amongst their
euil gods, and pacified them with sacrifice, least they should
hurt them. Some affirme that <b><i>Manes</i></b> are ind&eacute;ed infernall
gods, but yet good: whereof commeth <b><i>Mane</i></b>, which signifieth
good, and <b><i>Dii Manes</i></b>, as if you would say, good and prosperous
gods, and therof also is said <b><i>Immanes</i></b>, for, not good.</p>

<p>Some other suppose, that soules separated from the bodies,
were called after this name: Wherby we s&eacute;e the auncient
monuments of tumbes haue bene dedicated to <b><i>Diis Manibus</i></b>, to the infernall gods:
In the which opinion <b>Apuleius</b>
was, as we said a little before.</p>

<p>There are some that iudge <b><i>Manes</i></b>, to be the very same,
that the old people called <b><i>Genii</i></b>, and that there were two of
these <b><i>Manes</i></b> assigned vnto mens bodies, euen immediately
after their begetting, which forsake them not wh&#275; they are
dead, but continue in the graues after the bodies are consumed.
For the which cause, those men who defaced Monuments,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

were thought to doo wrong vnto the gods called
<b><i>Manes</i></b>. The soothsayers called as well the celestiall as the
infernall gods by the name of <b><i>Manes</i></b>, and that because they
bel&eacute;eued (as <b>Festus</b> doth write) that all things did <b><i>manare</i></b>,
that is, were deriued from them. Other thinke they were
so called <b><i>à manando</i></b>, of flowing, because the places betw&eacute;en
the circle of the Moone and the earth, from whence they
come, are full of soules.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maniæ.</div>

<p><b><i>Maniæ</i></b> are deformed creatures, as <b>Festus</b> saith: and also
vgly shapes, wherwith nursses make children afraid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mormo.</div>

<p><span class="gktext">&mu;&omicron;&rho;&mu;&omega;</span>,

hereof it is taken for a heg: as also

doth signifie a terrible sight, a spirit, or an elfe. <b>Nicephorus</b> saith
in his Ecclesiasticall history, that a woman vsing to walke
by night, is called by the name of <b>Gilo</b>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamiæ.</div>

<p><b>L<i>amiæ</i></b> were supposed of the auncient people to be women
hauing eies to put out or in at their pleasure, or rather
certaine shapes of diuels, which taking on them the shewe
of beautifull women, deuoured children and yoong men, allured
vnto them with sw&eacute;ete inticements.</p>

<p><b>Philostratus</b> in his booke <b>Appollonio</b>, writeth a maruellous
history or fable of one <b>Menippus</b>, beloued of an hegge.
The same authour writeth, that <b>L<i>amiæ</i></b> are called of some
men <b>L<i>aruæ</i></b>, spirits walking by night: and <b>L<i>emurei</i></b>, night
spirits of horrible shapes: and of many <b><i>Empusa</i></b>, ghoasts of
variable fashion: and that nursses so named them to make
their children afraide.</p>

<p><b>Chrysostomus Dion</b> writeth, that in the inmost part of
<b><i>Affrike</i></b> are certain wild beasts, hauing the countenance of
a woman, which in like manner are called <b>L<i>amiæ</i></b>: and he
saith that they haue their paps and al the rest of their breast
so faire as any Painters wit can deuise, which being vncouered,
they deceitfully allure men vnto them, and when
they haue taken them, doo forthwith deuoure them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Striges.</div>

<p><b><i>Lamiæ</i></b> are also called <b><i>Striges</i></b>. <b><i>Striges</i></b> (as they say) are
vnluckie birdes, which sucke out the blood of infantes lying
in their cradles. And hereof some men will haue Witches
take their name, who also are called <b><i>Volaticæ</i></b>, as <b>Festus</b>
writeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gorgones.</div>

<p>The name of <b><i>Gorgon</i></b>, was inuented to make children afraid:

<div class="sidenote">Incubi.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Succubi.</div>

<p><b><i>Ephialtæ</i></b>, and <b><i>Hyphialtæ</i></b>,
that is, <b><i>Incubi</i> &amp; <i>Succubi</i></b>, (which we
call Maares) are night spirits or rather Diuels, which leape vpon men
in their sl&eacute;epe. The Phisitians do affirme, that these are nothing else
but a disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Empusa.</div>

<p><b><i>Empusa</i></b>, is an apparition of the Diuel, or a spirit which
sheweth it selfe vnto such as are in misery, chaunging his

noone time. Read more hereof in <b>Suidas</b>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dicelon.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hecatæa.</div>

<p><b><i>Dicelon</i></b>, is so called because it is sent to make men afraid: those

where he intreateth of them. For he prooueth out of

vnto men.</p>

<p>Some of these Monsters which are ind&eacute;ede, bee of the

<p>Thus much concerning tearmes, which we must vse
in this our Treatise of Spirits or Visions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portentum.</div>

<p>For vaine imaginations also appeare vnto our sights: armed
men as it were are seene on earth, or in the aire: and
other such like shapes, voyces, noyses, crackes, and such
like. But as touching the very words, <b><i>Portentum</i></b> is that
which foresheweth some thing to come, as when straunge
bodies appeare in the aire, or blazing starres, or thunder in
faire weather, or whirlewindes do chaunce. <b>Festus</b> saith,
that albeit <b><i>Portentum</i></b> be a naturall thing, yet it happeneth
sildome, and doth betoken some thing to come to passe after
a certaine season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ostentum.</div>

thing to come to effect speedily. They giue the like examples
of them both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prodigium.</div>

<p><b><i>Prodigium</i></b>, is a thing which albeit it often chaunce by
course of nature, yet notwithstanding it doth alwaies betoken
some euill thing, being called <b><i>Prodigium</i></b>, as it were of
<b><i>porro agendum</i></b>, to be done afterward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monstrum.</div>

<p><b><i>Monstrum</i></b>, is that which hapneth against nature, as
when any thing is brought foorth hauing members belonging
to an other kinde: the which is also called <b><i>Promonstrum</i></b>,
as who should say, <b><i>Porro aliquid monstrans, siue monens</i></b>,
that is, shewing or warning some thing to happen afterward.
Notwithstanding these termes are many times confounded
togither, and taken in one signification, and that
because they respect one ende, that is, to tell before or giue
warning of things to come. The vaine visions wheron we
here intreat, appertaine nothing to naturall philosophers,
neither yet these things which we haue ioyned with them.
For if a sodaine cracke, or sound, or groning, or rumbling,
as though the house would fall, or if any other thing chance
which standeth by naturall reason, it doth not properly belong
vnto this matter which we haue in hand. But letting
these things passe, we will by Gods helpe and aide come
nearer to the matter it selfe.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Melancholike persons, and mad men, imagine many things<br />

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_ts.png" alt="T" width="150" height="164" /></p>

<div class="sidenote">Some men
deny there are Spirits.</div>

<p>Here haue bin very many in al ages, which
haue vtterly denied that there bee any spirits
or straunge sightes. The Philosophers
of <b>Epicurus]</b> sect, did iest &amp; laugh at all those
things which were reported of them, and
counted them as fained and counterfeyt, by
the which only children and fooles, and plaine simple men
were made afraide. When <b>Cassius</b>, who was an <b>Epicurian</b>,
vnderstood by <b>Brutus</b>, that he had s&eacute;ene a certaine vision, he
(as <b>Plutarch</b> doth testifie) indeuoured to attribute the matter
vnto naturall causes. We read in the 23. chapter of the

<span class="sidenote"><i>Act.</i>23.</span>

Actes of the Apostles, that the Sadduces did not bel&eacute;eue
there should be any Resurrection of the dead, and that they
denied there were any spirites or angels: Yea and at this
day, many good &amp; godly men bel&eacute;eue those things to be but
tales, which are talked of too and fro concerning those imagined
visions: partly because in all their life, they neuer
sawe any such, and partly or rather especially, because in
time past men haue bin so often deceiued with apparitions,
visions and false miracles done by Monkes and Priestes,
that now they take things y&#877; are true, to be as vtterly false.
Whatsoeuer the cause is, it may be proued, by witnesse of
many writers, and by daily experience also, that spirites
and strange sightes do sometime appeare, and that in very
d&eacute;ed many strange and maruellous things do happen.
True it is, that many men do falsly perswade themselues
that they s&eacute;e or heare ghoasts: for that which they imagine
they s&eacute;e or heare, proc&eacute;edeth either of melancholie, madnesse,
weakenesse of the senses, feare, or of some other perturbation:
or else when they s&eacute;e or heare beasts, vapors, or
some other naturall thing, then they vainly suppose, they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

haue s&eacute;ene sightes I wotte not what, as hereafter I will
shewe particularly by many and notable examples.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, but that almost al those things which
the common people iudge to be wonderfull sightes, are nothing
lesse than so. But in the meane season it cannot be
denied, but that straunge sightes, and many other such lyke
things, are sometimes heard and also s&eacute;ene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sundry imaginations
of
melancholike
persons.</div>

<p>And first it cannot be denied, but that some men which either by
dispositions of nature, or for that they haue susteined great miserie,
are now become heauie and full of melancholy, imagine many times with
themselues being alone, miraculous and straunge things. Sometimes they
affirme in great soothe, that they verily heare and s&eacute;e this or that
thing, whiche notwithstanding neither they, nor yet any other man did
once s&eacute;e or heare. Which thing we sometimes s&eacute;e by experience to be
true in those men, which be troubled with great headache, or subiect
to other diseases of the bodie, or cannot take rest in the night, or
are distraughted of their wittes. Those which dwell with suche kinde of
men, when they here them tell such absurd tales, such straunge things,
and such maruellous visions, albeit they pittie their vnfortunate
estate, yet can they not many times containe themselues from laughing.
<b>Aristotle</b> in his booke <b><i>de rebus mirandis</i></b>, writeth of a
certaine man distraught of his wittes, who going into the Theatre
of <b><i>Abydos</i></b> a Cittie of <b><i>Asia</i></b>, when no man was therein, and there
sitting alone, by clapping of his hands, signified that he liked as
well euery thing there, as if some Comedie or Tragedie had bin notably
set foorth on a stage. The verie lyke Historie hath <b>Horace</b>, in
his second booke of Epistles, of a certain man, who comming into the

<span class="sidenote">Theatrum a place to behold plaies and pastimes in.</span>

Theatre at <b><i>Argos</i></b>, behaued himselfe
euen as the other man did: And when his kinsfolke through the helpe of good Phisitians, had restored
him to his right wittes againe, he was very angry with them, saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that he neuer liued more pleasantly than while he was beside himselfe.

<b>Atheneus lib.</b> 12. writeth of one <b>Tresilaus</b>, whose
braines were so distempered, that he verily supposed all the ships
which arriued at Port <b>Piræus</b>, to be his owne: he would number
them, he commaunded the Mariners to launch from shore, and when they
returned after their voyage home againe, he as much reioyced as if he
had bene owner of all wherewith they were laden. The same man affirmed,
that in all the time of his madnesse he liued a verie pleasant life,
vntill the Phisitian had cured him of his disease. I myselfe haue s&eacute;ene
<span class="sidenote">Iohannes Sertorius.</span>
a man, <b>Iohannes Leonardus Sertorius</b> by name, whom very honest
and graue men, which knew him well, would testifie to be a godly man,
which was throughly perswaded with himselfe, that h&eacute;e could prooue
our Religion which we now professe, to be true and Catholike, euen by
a miracle from heauen as sometime <b>Helias</b> did. He desired the
Magistrates of certain Countries to call togither their Papists, and
Protestants: for he was readie (he sayd) to shewe this miracle, and in
case he did it not openly before them all, he refused not to sustain
any kynd of punishment. The lyke reason is also of other men whiche are
besides themselues: for they take on them maruellous things, either
because they haue mused long time on some matter conceiued in their
minds, as cunning Artificers oftentimes doo: or because they haue bin
long weried with sicknesse, or else because they loue extremely. You
shall finde some that imagine themself as it were armed with horns of
<span class="sidenote">Ste. Ludouic. Cæliu. li 17. ca.2 antiquitat.</span>
an Oxe: other appeare to themselues to be erthen vessels, and therfore
they wil shun euery thing for feare they be broken.</p>

their pypes and played on them euery daye: And h&eacute;e verily thoughte,
that he sawe them, some sitting, and some standing, and in such sorte
continually pyping without intermission, that they ceased at no time,
neither in the day, nor in the night. And therfore he neuer ceased to
crie, and to commaunde his seruants to driue them out of his doores.
When he was throughly recouered of his sicknesse, then he tolde all
other things which euery one of them had sayd or done: and also he

<p><b><i>Ephialtes</i></b>, which the Phisitions call the Maare, is a disease
of the stomacke, concerning which, reade <b>Paulus Aegineta

imagine that a man of monstrous stature sitteth on them,
which with his hands violently stoppeth their mouth, that
they can by no meanes cry out, and they striue with their

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_tl.png" alt="T" width="150" height="160" />
Hat whiche we haue hitherto spoken
concerning melancholicke men, and
men out of their wits, may also be vnderstood
of timorous and fearefull men.
For if any man be timorous by nature,
or subiect to feare through great daungers,
or by some other wayes, he also
imagineth straunge things which ind&eacute;ed
are not so, especially if he haue in him any store of melancholy.
<span class="sidenote">2.<i>Pet.</i>3.</span>
Women, which for the most part are naturally
giuen to feare more than men, (for which cause S. <b>Peter</b> in
his first Epistle speaking of the dutie of married folks, calleth
them the weaker vessell,) do more often suppose they
s&eacute;e or heare this or that thing, than men doo. And so do yoong
women, because commonly they are afraide. If when men
sit at the table, mention be made of spirites and elues, many
times women and children are so afraide that they dare
scarce go out of doores alone, least they should meete with
some euill thing: and if they chaunce to heare any kinde of
noise, by and by they thinke there are some spirites behinde
them, such vaine perswasions they haue. A cowardly souldiour
iudgeth his enemies to be more in number than they
are: the noyse of a leafe being mooued so affrighteth him
(which thing God in his lawe threatneth his people of <b><i>Israel</i></b>,
except they do their duties) that he betaketh himself to
his h&eacute;eles: if he but heare a woodspeck with his bill beating
on a tr&eacute;e, he straight thinketh the enemy readie to leape on
his shoulders: yea if he heare but a mouse moue, by and by
his heart is in his hose. These and such like things neuer
trouble a stout and couragious souldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet sometimes in the chase, lustie souldiers flying away
from their companie, are so troubled in minde, that
they thinke their friends enemies, and cannot tell in the
world where they are, and whither they go: all the which
commeth by feare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plutarche.</div>

<p><b>Plutarche</b> in his booke<b><i>De sera numinis vindicta</i></b>, reporteth
a maruellous and notable historie, of one called <b>Bessus</b>:
who after he had murthered his father, hid himselfe a
long season. But on a time as he went to supper, espying
a swallowes neast, with his speare be thrust it downe: and
when those which supped togither with him, misliked and
abhorred his cruelty (for we like not those men that trouble
little birdes and other beastes, because we iudge them austere
and cruell) he answered: haue they not (saieth h&eacute;e)
falsly accused me, a great while crying out on me, that I
haue slaine and murthered my father. Those which were
present, being striken with great admiration, reported
these his words to the king, who immediately caused him
to bee tormented, and examining the matter diligently, at
the last found him guiltie, and punished him as a manquiller
of his owne father. Hereof ye may gather what feare
can doo: the swallowes coulde not speake, and yet he perswaded
himselfe that they vpbrayed him with murthering
his father. Euen so many through feare, imagine that they
heare and s&eacute;e many thinges whiche in d&eacute;ede are m&eacute;ere
trifles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodoricus
imagining
that he seeth
Symmachus.</div>

<p><b>Procopius</b> in the beginning of the warres of <b><i>Italie</i></b>, declareth,
that as <b>Theodoricus</b> satte at meate, after he had
put to death <b>Boethius</b> and <b>Symmachus</b> his sonne in lawe,
a fishes head being brought before him, he sawe in it the
countenance of <b>Symmachus</b> looking horribly, which byting
the nether lip with lowring eyes s&eacute;emed to threaten him,
wherewith the King being sore abashed, fell into a gr&eacute;euous
sicknesse, wherof he afterwards died. Yea feare if it be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

vnmeasurable maketh vs to abhorre those thinges, which
otherwise should be comfortable vnto vs. The apostles of
<span class="sidenote">Matth.14.</span>
our Lord Iesus Christ may be examples hereof. Who in
the night season being in greate daunger in the Sea, when
they sawe Christe walking on the water approching towards
them wer maruelously appalled. For they supposed
they sawe a Spirit, and cried out for feare. But the Lorde
came to deliuer them out of that present daunger wherein
they were. After his resurrection they were maruellously
affraide, and as S. Luke saith, they verily supposed they
<span class="sidenote">Luke.24.</span>
sawe a Spirit, when in d&eacute;ede he appeared vnto them in his
owne body. Therfore the lord comforteth &amp; hartneth them
saying: Behold my hands &amp; my f&eacute;et, for I am eu&#275; he: handle
me and s&eacute;e: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye s&eacute;e I
haue. They through great ioy could not bel&eacute;eue it, but maruelled
at it. H&eacute;ere thou s&eacute;est, by feare it came to passe, that
the Disciples supposed y&#868; Lord him self to haue bin a ghost.
And therfore no man ought to maruell if we hindered by
feare, mistake one man for an other, and perswade our
selues that we haue s&eacute;ene spirits, whereas no such were.
<span class="sidenote">Stout and coragious men seldom see any Spirits.</span>
They which are of stout and hautie courage, fr&eacute;e from all
feare, seldome times s&eacute;e any spirits. It is reported of the
Scithians, a warlike nati&#333; dwelling in mountains (from
whom it is thought the Turkes take their originall) that
they neuer s&eacute;e any vaine sightes of spirits. Authors write
that Lions are not feared with any bugs: for they are full
of stomacke and deuoide of feare.</p>

s&eacute;e any thing, except it be verie neare their eyes (as for the
most part students are, which night and day turne ouer
their bookes) are so much deceiued in their sight, that they
are many times ashamed to vtter what they haue thought
they haue s&eacute;ene. And it standeth by naturall reason, that an
oare s&eacute;emeth to be broken in the water: and a tower foure

<span class="sidenote">Dronken men see straunge things.</span>

cornered, a farre off sheweth to be rounde. Those which
drinke wine immoderately, in such sort that their eyes begin
to waxe dimme, and stare out of their heads, like hares
which haue bin caried hanging on a staffe a mile or twaine,
s&eacute;e things farre otherwise than sober men doo. They suppose
they s&eacute;e two candles on the table, when there is but
one: desiring to reach the potte, they put their hand amisse.<span class="sidenote">Euripides.</span>
In <b>Euripides</b> Tragedie named <b>Bacchis</b>,
<b>Pentheus</b> affirmeth,
that he seeth two Sunnes and two citties of <b><i>Thebes</i></b>:
For his braines were maruellously distempered. It is a
common saying, that if wine haue the victorie, all things
seeme to haue turned vpside downe: tr&eacute;es to walke, mountaines
to be moued, and riuers to run against the head, &amp;c.
<b>Salomon</b> exhorteth all men from drunkennesse, in his prouerbs,
cap.23. shewing what discommodities ensue therof,
and amongst other thinges he saith thus: Thy eyes shall
s&eacute;e straunge (to wit) visitions and maruellous apparitions.
For as timorous men imagine miraculous things, euen so
doo drunken men, who of purpose corrupt and spoile their
sight. And albeit God shew many wonders in the aire, and
in the earth, to the ende he may stir men vp from idlenesse
and bring them to true repentaunce, yet notwithstanding,
we must thinke that dronken men which sit vp vntill midnight,
do often say, that haue s&eacute;ene this or that vision, they
haue beheld this or that wonder, when as ind&eacute;ed they are
vtterly deceiued. For in case they had returned home in
due season, and not ouercharged themselues with too much
wine, no such thing had appeared vnto them. For ind&eacute;ede
their eyesight had not bene blinded. Doth it not often come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to passe, that when men are once throughly warmed with
wine, they mistake one for another, of whom they thought
they were abused in word or d&eacute;ede, and violently flie on
them with weapon? The place before alleaged out of <b>Salomon</b>,
may also be vnderstood to this purpose: Thy eyes
shall s&eacute;e straunge (to wit,) women, to lust after them. For
experience teacheth vs that men being drunke, assaie to rauish
matrones and maidens, which being sober they would
neuer once think vppon. Wine immoderately taken, is
the nurse of rashe boldnesse and filthie lust.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some see
themselues.</div>

<p><b>Aristotle</b> writeth, that some men through the f&eacute;eblenesse
of their sight, beholding in the aire neare vnto them (as it
were in a glasse) a certaine image of themselues, suppose
they s&eacute;e their owne angels or soules: and so as the Prouerbe
is, they feare their owne shadow. Although men in
obscure and darke places can s&eacute;e nothing, yet do they not (I
pray you) imagine they s&eacute;e diuers kindes of shapes and colours.
And we many times suppose those things which we
s&eacute;e, to be farre otherwise than ind&eacute;ed they are.</p>

<p>It is well knowne, a mans sight may be so deceiued,
that he verily thinkes that one deuoureth a sword, spitteth
out money, coales, and such like: that one eateth bread, and
spitteth foorth meale: one drinketh wine, which after runneth
out of his forehead: that one cutteth off his fellowes
head, which afterwardes he setteth on againe: and that a
Cocke s&eacute;emeth to drawe after him a huge beame of timber,
&amp;c. Moreouer it may be brought to passe by naturall
things, as by perfumes and such like, that a man would
sweare in earnest, that all men sitting at the table with
him, haue no heds at all, or else that they are like the heads
of asses: &amp; that somtimes a vine spreadeth it self as it were
ouer al the house, wh&#275; ind&eacute;ed it is a mere deceit, or a plaine
iugling cast. Of which matter there be bookes commonly
<span class="sidenote">Hearing deceiueth.</span>
set abroad. The like reason is in hearing, &amp; in the other senses.
Those men whose hearing is somewhat decaied, many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
times s&eacute;eme in their owne imagination, to heare the noyse
of boysterous winde, or violent tempest, the sparkling of
fire, the roaring of waters sodeinly increased, singing and
sounding of instruments, and also the iangling of belles,
when as indeed these things are not so, but only chaunce by
default of hearing: for others which are conuersant with
them, hauing the right vse of hearing, do not heare any such
thing at all. Somtimes in very d&eacute;ed such things are heard,
as the crackling of wainscot walles, and such like, which
are naturall signes of some tempest shortly after ensuing.</p>

<p>There are also certaine hollowe places, through the
which the winde whiszing, giueth a pleasant sound, as it
were through a pipe, much like vnto singing, so that men
wonder verie much thereat. We reade in writers of Philosophie,
that the very same also chaunceth in bankes of riuers,
which bende a little in compasse. Hearing is also deceiued
when we thinke we heare thunder, and it is ind&eacute;ed
<span class="sidenote">The sense of feeling is deceiued.</span>
but the rumbling of some Carte. There be many which
thinke they handle something, and yet are deceiued: If
men sicke of the ague, drinke wine of the best and sw&eacute;etest
sorte, yet they thinke it is more bitter than Gall: if they
eate pottage neuer so good, yet they iudge it vnsauorie:
which thing commeth not of any faulte in the Cooke, but of
the mouth and stomacke whiche is distempered with sicknesse.
For vnto them which haue abundance of choller, all
things s&eacute;eme bitter. And euen so it commeth to passe, that a
man supposeth he seeth, heareth, f&eacute;eleth, or is felt of some
spirit, when ind&eacute;ed it is not so, and yet no man can perswade
him the contrary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VVeakenesse
of the sight
and feare.</div>

<p>If feare and weaknesse of the sight and of other senses

true: Neither will they be brought from their owne opinions
by any meanes or reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>We reade that not only perticular and priuate men, but
also whole armies of souldiers generally haue bene so deceiued,
that they haue verily thought their enemies hard at
their h&eacute;eles, when as no man followed. And hereof haue
proc&eacute;eded many horrible flightes in battaile.</p>

<p><b>Cominæus</b>, a knight and diligent writer of histories,
in the ende of his first booke of the Acts of <b>Lewes</b> the II.
King of <b><i>Fraunce</i></b>, writeth, that when
<b>Charles</b> Duke of <b><i>Burgundie</i></b>,
with other Princes, had remooued their armie to
<b><i>Paris</i></b>, they vnderstood by their espials, that the next day the
king had determined to set on them with all his power of
men. Wherefore the next day <b>Charles</b> sent out certaine
horsemen to view his enemies: who comming foorth, by
reason that the element was somewhat darke, supposed
they sawe a huge number of pikes and speares, but when
they had passed a little further and that the aire was a little
clearer, they vnderstood the same place wherein they iudged
the king to be with all his armie, to be planted and ouergrowne
with many high thistles, which a far off shewed
as it had bene long speares. For the night beguileth
mens eyes. And therefore none ought to maruell, if trauellers
towardes night or at midnight, mistake stones,
tr&eacute;es, stubbes, or such like, to be sprites or elues. We reade
in the last booke of the kings the 3.chap. that after the death
<span class="sidenote">King.4.</span>
of king <b>Achab</b>, the Moabites reuolted from <b>Ioram</b> his
sonne, wherefore he desired <b>Iosaphat</b> to aide him, and with
all his power he determined to make warre on the Moabites,
to reduce them to obedience, and subiection. Which
thing when the Moabites heard, they prepared to defend
themselues, so many as were able to beare armour. But
when they had set foreward verie earely in the morning
against their enemies, supposing in the rising of the
Sunne, the waters which God had miraculously brought
out to be redde, they said amongst themselues: Surely the
two Kings haue encountred togither, and eache haue destroyed

Urthermore, it commeth to passe many
times that not only pleasant and mery
conceited men, but also spitefull and
malitious men, chaunging their apparell,
make others extreamely affraide.
It is a common custome in many places,
that at a certaine time of the yeare,
one with a nette or vizarde on his face
maketh Children affraide, to the ende that euer after they
should laboure and bee obedient to the Parentes, afterward
they tel them that those which they saw, were Bugs,
Witches and Hagges, which thing they verily bel&eacute;eue, and
are commonly, miserably affraide. Howbeit, it is not expedient
alwayes so to terrefie Children. For sometimes
through great feare they fall into dangerous diseases, and
<span class="sidenote">Salomons pro.</span>
in the night crie out, when they are fast a sl&eacute;epe. <b>Salomon</b>
teacheth vs to chasten children with the rod, and so to make
them stand in awe: he doth not say, we must beare them in
hand they shall be deuoured of Bugges, Hags of the night,
and such like monsters.</p>

<p>Many times, pleasant &amp; mery yong men, disguise themselues
like vnto Diuels, or ofe shroud themselues in white
sh&eacute;etes to make other men affraide: with whome if simple
men chaunce to m&eacute;ete, they make no doubt of the matter,
but verily thinke they haue s&eacute;ene spirites, and straunge
sightes. And yet it is not alwayes the safest way, so to deceiue

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

men with iests and toyes; for many examples might
be brought to shewe how euill some men haue sped hereby.
It is an vsuall and common thing that yoong men merily
disposed, when they trauell by the way, comming to their
Inne at night, tie ropes to the bed side, or to the couerlet
or garments, or else hide themselues vnder the bedde, and
so counterfeiting themselues to be Spirites, deceiue and
mocke their fellowes. It chaunced once at <b><i>Tigurin</i></b> where
<span class="sidenote">Daunsing Spirits.</span>
we dwel, that certaine pleasant yong men disguising themselues,
daunced about the Churchyard, one of them playing
on a b&eacute;ere with two bones, as it were on a drumme.
Which thing when certaine men had espied, they noysed it
about the citie, how they had s&eacute;ene dead men daunce, and
that there was great danger, least there should shortly ensue
some plague or pestilence.</p>

<p>Moreouer, it is well knowne to all men, that harlots,
and whooremongers, haue practised their wickednesse a
long season vnder this cloake and pretence, perswading
their family, that walking Spirites haunt the house, least
they should bee taken with the d&eacute;ede dooing, and that they
might enioy their desired loue. Many times such bugges
haue bin caught by the magistrates, and put to open shame.
Th&eacute;eues likewise vnder this colour haue many times robbed
their neighboures in the night time, who supposing
they heard the noyse of walking Spirits, neuer went about
to driue the th&eacute;eues away. Touching this point, that an euil

vertues, can do maruellous things, by deceiuing mens senses,

O these thinges may bee added, that there
haue bin in all ages certaine Priests, which
practising strange deuises, and giuing themselues
to Necromancie, haue bewitched foolish
men that highly est&eacute;emed them, to the
ende they might thereby encrease their riches,
and follow their lustfull pleasures. Touching which
matter, to the ende godly disposed men may be the more
h&eacute;edfull, I will rehearse a fewe histories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iosephus de
antiquitatib.</div>

<p><b>Iosephus</b> a writer of histories, in his 18.booke and 4.chap.
of Antiquities, remembreth a notorious deed which hapned
at <b>Rome</b>, in the time of <b>Tyberius Cesar</b> vnder the pretence
of sacrificing to the goddesse <b>Isis</b>. I will record the historie
as it is translated by <b>Galenius</b>, a very learned man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paulina and
Mundus.</div>

<p>There dwelled at <b>Rome</b> a woman named <b>Paulina</b>, no
lesse renoumed for honestie of life, than for the nobilitie of
parentage: She was also very rich and exc&eacute;eding beautful,
as one that was now in the floure of her age, and especially
adorned with the great vertue of chastitie, and married she
was to one <b>Saturnius</b>, a man worthie of such a wife. It
chaunced that <b>Decius Mundus</b>, a famous yoong knight, became
very much enamored with her: and because she was a
woman of greater wealth than that she might be won with
rewardes and money, so much the more was this louers
madnesse inflamed, in so much that he stuck not to proffer
her for one night .200000. groates. The Atticke groat and
the Romain peny are by common valuation all one. <b>Budeus</b>
accounteth one of them worth 8. Crusados: so this summe
according to his reckoning, amounteth to 26000. Florens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruffinus.</div>

<p>And yet not being able by these means to moue her constant
mind, bicause he could not endure the rage of his loue,
he determined, by abstinence and hunger to make an ende
both of life and loue togither. This determination was
not vnknowne to <b>Ide</b>, <b>Mundus</b> Fathers bondseruaunt, a
maide cunning in many artes, but such as were not to be
liked. She maruellously gr&eacute;eued with the yoong mans wilfulnesse
in absteining fr&#333; meat, talking with him, by sw&eacute;ete
and flattring words began to encourage him, assuring him
that she would bring to passe, that he should at his pleasure
embrace <b>Paulina</b>. After that he had gladly condiscended to
her entreatie, she telleth him she must n&eacute;edes haue fiftie
thousand groates to ouerthrow the Gentlewomans chastitie.
So putting the yoong man in good hope, and receiuing
as much mony as she required, because she wel knew <b>Paulina</b>
could not be wonne with mony, she deuiseth a new way
to deceiue her. Vnderstanding therefore that she was maruellously
addicted to the worshipping of <b>Isis</b>, she inuenteth
these meanes: She talketh with some of <b>Isis</b> Priests, and
hauing receiued sure promise of them to k&eacute;epe all things
secrete, and (which is most effectuall) hauing shewed their
reward, promising presently 25000. groates, and when
they had done the d&eacute;ed, other 25000. she openeth vnto them
the yoong mans loue, bes&eacute;eching them to helpe by al means
possible, that sh&eacute;e might enioy the same. They touched
at the heart with desire of the mony, gently promised their
helpe. Wherefore the eldest of them sp&eacute;edily goeth to
<b>Paulina</b>, and being admitted to her sp&eacute;ech, after hee had
obtained to talke with her in secrete, he declareth that he
is come vnto her being sent by the great God <b>Anubis</b> (this
<b>Anubis</b> hauing a head lyke to a Dogge, was worshipped
togither in one Temple with <b>Isis</b>) who is maruellously in
loue with her beautie, and doth commaund her to repaire
vnto him. She ioyfully receiued the message, and forthwith
vaunteth among her familiar acquaintaunce, that the God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<b>Anubis</b> hath vouchsafed to loue her: And sh&eacute;e telleth her
husband, that sh&eacute;e must suppe and lye with him. Which
thing was so much the more easily graunted vnto her, for
that her husband had had good experience and knowledge
of her chastitie. Whereupon sh&eacute;e goeth to the Temple,
and after supper when time of rest drew neare, being shut
in by the priest, sh&eacute;e m&eacute;eteth with <b>Mundus</b>, who had priuily
hidden himselfe there, the darkenesse bringing them
togither, without any suspition. And so all that night sh&eacute;e
satisfied the yong mans desire, supposing she had done pleasure
vnto the God. Afterwards he departing from hir, <b>Paulina</b>
early in the morning, before the priestes (who were
priuie to this deceit) were stirring, returned home to her
husband, to whome she recounteth her meeting with <b>Anubis</b>,
and also with great words setteth out the same amongst
her gossips and friends. They could not bel&eacute;eue her, considering
the nature of the thing, and yet could they not chuse
but maruell, waying the great chastitie of the woman.
Thr&eacute;e dayes after the d&eacute;ede done, <b>Mundus</b> m&eacute;eting by
chaunce with his beloued, saide vnto her: O well done <b>Paulina</b>,
thou hast saued me 200000. groats wherewith thou
mightest haue encreased thy riches, and yet notwithstanding
thou hast fulfilled my desire, for I way it not that
thou hast despised <b>Mundus</b>, sith vnder the title of <b>Anubis</b>,
I haue enioyed my desired lust, which words said, he departed.
But the woman then first perceiuing this villany,
began to teare her garments, and opening the whole matter
vnto her husband, bes&eacute;echeth him that he suffer not such
a notorious mockery to go vnpunished. Her husband then
declareth the whole matter to the Emperoure <b>Tiberius</b>:
who after he had learned all things by diligent examination,
trusseth vp these iugling priests on the gallowes, togither
with <b>Ide</b>, the author of all this mischiefe, by whose
meanes chiefly the chastitie of this noble Gentlewoman
was defiled: and ouerthrowing their temple, he commaunded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the Image of <b>Isis</b> to be sunke in the riuer of <b><i>Tibris</i></b>. But
it pleased him to chasten <b>Mundus</b> with banishment, a more
gentle kind of punishm&#275;t, ascribing his fault to y&#868; weaknes
of his immoderat loue. By this history it may easily be gathered
how sathan in times past bewitcht the Gentils, and
how their priests persuaded them y&#877; their Gods appearing
in visible forme spake this or y&#877; vnto them, which notwithst&#257;ding
were very false. Vnder the pretence of worshipping
their gods, they gaue th&#275;selues to wicked deuises. For how
often may we wel thinke they c&#333;mitted abhominable mischief
(although ind&eacute;ed y&#868; matter it selfe neuer came to light.)
If they brought it to passe, y&#877; <b>Mundus</b> by their meanes enioyed
his desired loue, surely there is no doubt, but y&#877; they
th&#275;selues vnder the colour of holinesse defloured other m&#275;s
daughters &amp; wiues: for otherwise this deuise could neuer
haue bin so ready in mind. This matron would neuer haue
bin so wel c&#333;tent, vnles y&#868; very same had bin practised with
other dames before. Neither yet wold her husb&#257;d haue suffered
her to lodge in the Church all night. What n&eacute;ed was
there for y&#868; gods to haue beds prepared for th&#275; in y&#868; Church,
wh&#275; it was most aparant they neuer lodged in th&#275;. Princes
also may learne by y&#868; example of <b>Tiberius</b>, although he were
a wicked tyrant, how such varlets are to be restrained. To
this purpose maketh y&#877; historie which <b>Ruffinus</b> a Priest of <b><i>Aquilia</i></b>
reporteth in <b>Li.</b>11.<b>ca.</b>25. of his ecclesiasticall history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tyrannus a
wicked priest.</div>

<p>There was a priest in <b><i>Alexandria</i></b> in <b><i>Egipt</i></b>, vowed to <b>Saturn</b>,
whose name was <b>Tyr&#257;nus</b>. This m&#257; as it had bin fr&#333;
the mouth of god, vsed to say vnto al such noble &amp; principall
men, whose Ladies he liked &amp; lusted after, that <b>Saturne</b> had
c&#333;manded, y&#877; such a ones wife shuld lie al night in the temple.
Then he which heard y&#868; message, reioycing much y&#877; the
god vouchsafed to call for his wife, decking her vp brauely,
&amp; giuing her great gifts (forsooth lest she shuld be refused bicause
she came emptie) sent her foorth vnto y&#868; temple, where
the woman being shut vp in the presence of al men, <b>Tirannus</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wh&#275; he had fast locked the doores, surrendring the keyes
departed his wayes. Afterwards in great silence passing
through priuie caues vnder the ground, he issued foorth out
of the open holes into the image of <b>Saturne</b>: which image
was made hollow in the backe, and cunningly fastned to
the wall. And as the candles burned within the Church, he
spake sodeinly vnto the woman (giuing great care, and
praying deuoutly) through y&#868; image made of hollow brasse,
in such sort that the vnhappie woman, trembled betw&eacute;ene
feare and ioy, because she thought her selfe worthie of the
sp&eacute;ech of so great a god. Now after the baudie god had talked
his pleasure to bring her in great feare, or to prouoke
her to lust and wantonnesse, sodeinly all the lightes were
put out with the spreading abroad of sh&eacute;ets, by a certain cunning
deuise. And then descending out of the image, he committed
adultery with the woman much abashed and afraid,
vsing most profane and wicked gloses vnto her. When he
had thus dealt a long season, almost with all the wiues of
these silly Gentlemen, it chaunced in the end, that a certain
chast Gentlewoman began to abhorre and loath the deede,
and marking the matter more h&eacute;edfully, knew it to be <b>Tyrannus</b>
voice: and there vpon returning home againe, declared
the slie conueiance of this horrible d&eacute;ed vnto her husband.
He being set on fire with rage for the iniurie done
vnto his wife, or rather vnto his selfe, appreh&#275;ded <b>Tyrannus</b>,
&amp; brought him to y&#868; place of torments, where being conuicted
he c&#333;fessed al y&#868; matter, &amp; th&#275; other deceits being likewise
detected, al shame &amp; dishonor was spred throughout the
houses of y&#868; Pagans: the mothers were found adulterers,
fathers incestuous persons, and their children illegittimate
and bastardes. Which thing so soone as it was brought to
light and noysed abroad, togither both Church and image,
and wickednesse, and all was vtterly subuerted and destroied.

happen euen at this day also. For it is

and miracles, and familiar talking with soules.</p>

<p><b>Theodorus Lector, collectaneorum ex historia ecclesiastica
lib. 1</b>. writeth of <b>Timotheus Aelurus</b>, that he, before
<b>Proterius</b> bishop of <b>Alexandria</b> was put to death, gaping
for the bishoppricke, in the night cladde in blacke apparrell
walked about the celles of the Monkes, and calling eache
man by his name, they answering, sayd vnto them, that
he a spirit, one of Gods seruants came to warne them, that
euery one reuolting from <b>Proterius</b>, should ioyne himselfe
vnto <b>Timotheus</b>. And by his craft and deceit obteining the
bishoppricke, h&eacute;e made great vproares in the Church of
God. Here I cannot refraine my selfe as touching this present
matter, but that I rehearse a famous historie, of
foure Monkes of the order of Preachers (who were bernt
at <b>Berna</b> in <b>Heluetia</b>, in the yeare of our Lord 1509. the last
day of May) by what subtilties they deceiued a poore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
simple Frier whom they had lately reteined into their monastery:
concerning which thing, many bookes were written
at the same time when these things were done, which
are yet extant both in the Latin and in the Germain toong.
There was great contention betw&eacute;en the Monkes of y&#868; order
of Preachers, and the Friers <b>Minorites</b>, or <b>Franciscans</b>,
touching the concepti&#333; of y&#868; virgin <b>Mary</b>. The Friers preachers
affirmed, that she euen as other men also was conceiued
in originall sin, that the <b>Franciscans</b> denied and stoutly
denied. At the last the matter came to that issue, that the
preachers determined to auouch and prooue their opinion
by false and fayned miracles: taking aduisement in a certaine
Synode (which they call a chapter) holden at <b><i>Vimpenium</i></b>
a cittie of <b><i>Germanie</i></b>, where the most conuenient and
fittest place for this matter might be founde: and at the
last they chose out <b><i>Berna</i></b> in <b><i>Heluetia</i></b>, because the people
there were plaine and simple, and giuen to the warres.
Foure therefore of the chiefest in the Abbay of the order of
preachers beganne the pageant at <b><i>Berna</i></b>: and because the
Supprier one of the foure, was well seene in coniuring, he
bounde the Diuell to ioyne in councell with them by what
meanes they might best bring their purpose to passe. H&eacute;e
appearing vnto them in the likenesse of a <b>Negro</b> or blacke
Morian, promised them all that he could doo, vnder this
condition, that they should y&eacute;eld and giue themselues vnto
him, which thing they willingly did, deliuering vnto him
a writing written with their owne hand and blood. And it
chaunced at the same time very fitly, that one <b>Iohn Iezerus</b>,
a plaine fellowe, a Taylour by occupation, was chosen
into their order, who s&eacute;emed to be verie fit for their purpose.
They tryed him by throwing stones into his chamber
in the night time, making a great noyse, and faining
themselues to be Spirits. The matters s&eacute;emed vnto them,
euen from the beginning, that it would take good successe.
On a certaine day being Friday, the Supprior shrouding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
himselfe in a sh&eacute;ete, togither with other Spirites, whom he
had coniured vp for this purpose, brake into the Friers cell
with great force and noyse, faining with many teares, that
he desired his ayd and help. Now had they priuily conueied
Holy water and the Reliques of Saints into his Cell before.
The poore Frier halfe dead with feare, denied that he
could by any meanes helpe him, recommending himselfe
to Christ our Sauior, and to his holy mother. The Spirite
aunswered, that it was in his and his brethrens power
to deliuer him out of this miserie, if he would suffer himselfe
for the space of viij. dayes, euery day to be whipped vntill
the blood followed, and moreouer, cause eight Masses to
be sung for his sake in S. <b>Iohns</b> Chappell, himselfe while
they were sung, lying in the floore with his armes spread
abroad. After h&eacute;e tolde him that the next Friday before
midnight, he wold come again with greater noyse, willing
him in any wise not to be afrayd, for the Diuels could nothing
hurt him, because he was an holy man. The next day
this foolish Frier openeth all the matter to the ringleaders
of this deuise, bes&eacute;eching them to assist him, that the miserable
soule might be deliuered. The matter was out of hand
rumored about the Citie. The Monkes preached openly
hereof in the pulpit, commending highly y&#868; holinesse of their
order, which euen hereby might be s&eacute;ene, for that the spirite
craued helpe of them, and not of the wicked drunken
<b>Franciscans</b>. At the time appointed, the spirite accompanied
with the other euill spirits, came againe with great noyse
to the Friers Cell, who adiuring and coniuring him, questioned
with him touching certaine points. The spirit shewed
him who he was, and for what cause he was so miserably
vexed: and withall gaue great thanks both vnto him
and also to his fathers, for being touched w<sup>t</sup> remorse of him,
adding, y&#877; in case there were yet 30. Masses sung, and 4. Vigiles
obserued, and y&#877; he would yet once again whip himself
vntil he bled, th&#275; he shuld be clean deliuered out of most cruell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
torments, which he had c&#333;tinually endured a 160. y&eacute;ers.
He had conference with him also of other maruellous matters,
which we n&eacute;ed not here to reherse. Afterwards y&#868; same
spirit appeared again vnto the Frier, and preferred the order
of preachers before all others, bearing him in hand, that
many of them which had bene aduersaries vnto this order,
suffered most horrible torment in purgatorie, and that the
citie of <b><i>Berna</i></b> should be vtterly ouerthrowne, except they
banished y&#868; <b>Franciscans</b>, and refused y&#868; y&eacute;erly stipends which
they receiued at the French kings hands. He also talked of
sundry things which had hapned to the Frier (which thing
they had learned before of him by meanes of auricular confession.)
Moreouer he hartily thanketh the Frier for the
great benefit of his deliuerance, giuing him to vnderstand,
that he was now admitted into the eight degr&eacute;e of Angels,
and that he should say Masse there for his benefactors.</p>

<p>After these things thus done, an other night one comming
vnto him in the apparell of a woman, said he was <b>S.
Barbara</b>, whom he deuoutly serued, and told him y&#877; the blessed
virgin would shortly appear vnto him, and make ful answere
vnto those questions which one of the Monkes had
writt&#275; in paper for him. This paper <b>Barbara</b> promised that
she her self would deliuer vnto our Lady, which they should
shortly after find in a holy place sealed &amp; signed miraculously.
The Frier vpon this reuealeth the whole matter vnto
his fathers, desiring to be confessed of his sinnes, wherby he
might be found worthy the apparition or s&eacute;eing of our Lady.
He willed them to search in y&#868; halowed place for the scroll,
which at the last they found in the Fratry (as they term it)
where they had laid it before. Th&#275; they caried it with great
reuer&#275;ce vnto the high alter, affirming y&#877; it was sealed with
Christs blood, and that the tapers lightned of their own accord.
In the morning the virgin <b>Mary</b> appeared vnto him
againe, rehearsing many things which her sonne Iesus
commaunded her to tell vnto him; to wit, that Pope <b>Iulius</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was that holy man, which should reconcile the two orders
in friendship againe, and institute and ordaine the feast of
the defiled conception of our Lady, for she would send vnto
the Pope a crosse marked with foure droppes of her sonnes
blood, in signe that she was conceiued in originall sinne: and
that they should find an other crosse marked with fiue drops
of blood in their fratrie, which they must conuey to <b><i>Rome</i></b>,
for the Pope would allowe and confirme it with large indulgences,
and after return it to <b><i>Berna</i></b> again: other things
likewise she said, whereof many things were both reported
and written too and fro.</p>

<p>But in witnesse of the aforesaid things, the same <b>Mary</b>
droue an yron nayle through the hande of the poore Frier,
saying: this wounde shall be renewed in the day wherein
my sonne was crucified, and in the feast of my sonnes bodie.
After they tooke a burning water made by Necromancie,
by the which they taking away his senses, made foure
other woundes in his bodie. And after that he came againe
vnto himselfe, they bare him in hand that there was a certaine
holy thing I wotte not what, which appeared about
him. And when they sawe that many men came flocking
about him to s&eacute;e this newe Christ, they taught him (for h&eacute;e
was of rude conditions) howe to behaue himselfe. And
when they had giuen him a drinke ber&eacute;euing him of his
senses, and causing him to fome at the mouth, then they sayd
he striued and wrestled with death, euen as Christ did in
the mount Oliuet. After all this, another of them appeared
vnto him, telling him many things: but y&#868; Frier knowing
him by his voyce, beganne to suspect and mislike the whole
matter, and with violence thrust him from him. The next
night the Frier himselfe appeared vnto him, saying that he
was <b>Mary</b> of whome he had bene in doubt, and to the ende
he should be out of all suspition, she had brought him the
host of her sonnes bodie (for he brought him an host stiped
in poyson) to the ende h&eacute;e shoulde no more thinke he sawe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
an euil spirite: he also affirmed, that he had brought a vessel
of glasse full of her sonnes bloud, which he would giue
vnto him, and vnto his Monasterie. But the Frier, who
also had this vision in suspition, answered: If (sayde he)
thou be not an euil spirit, rehearse thy <b>Pater noster</b> and thy
<b>Aue Maria</b> with me. The Prior sayde the <b>Pater noster</b>,
and afterward sayd in the person of our Lady: <b>Hayled am
I Mary full of grace, the Lord be with me. &amp;c.</b> The Frier
knowing the Priors voyce, caught a knife, and wounded
him therewith, and when he defended himselfe, the Frier
stoutly resisted, and draue him backe. These things thus
done, the Supprior b&eacute;eing in good hope to restore all that
they had lost, appeared againe to the Frier, saying that he
was <b>S. Catherin</b> of <b><i>Sena</i></b>, and therwith begun to chide him,
for that he so discurteously had intreated the holy Virgin:
adding moreouer, I am sent (quoth he) to shewe th&eacute;e, that
the wounds which thou hast in thy body, are the very true
wounds of Christ, which neyther I, nor yet S. Francis
hath, and that he enlarged with many words. Yet notwithstanding,
the Frier so entertayned him, that he was
glad to saue him selfe with running away. Now bicause
the Frier wold no longer be mocked at their hands, they,
maruellously troubled, and almost at their wits ende, taking
aduise among them selues, brake the matter vnto
him, and tolde him, that in verie d&eacute;ede they fr&eacute;ely confessed
many of those apparitions which he had s&eacute;ene to be fayned,
and that for no other cause, but to the ende he should perseuere
in his profession and Religion, howbeit the very effect
of the matter was most true, and that he ought not to
doubt, but that he bare the wounds of Christ in his body.
And forsomuch as the matter was nowe knowen abroad,
they earnestly besought him, that he would not refuse to go
on in the matter, for otherwise their order should incurre
open shame, and both he and they fall into present daunger,
but in case he woulde persist in his enterprised purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the thing would fall out to his and their great aduantage.
And so with fairer words, they perswaded him to
make promise to be ruled by them hereafter.</p>

<p>After long instruction and teaching, they placed him on
the altar of our Lady, kn&eacute;eling on his kn&eacute;es within a chappell
before the image of the holy virgine: Where one of
the Monkes standing behinde a cloath, spake through a
cane r&eacute;ede, as if it were Christ talking with his mother, in
this wise: Mother why dost thou weepe? haue I not promised
th&eacute;e, y&#877; whatsoeuer thou willest, shall be done? Wherto
the image made answere. Therfore I w&eacute;epe, bicause this
businesse findeth no end. Then said the image of Christ:
Bel&eacute;eue mee mother, this matter shall be made manifest.
This doone, the Monke priuily departing, the chappell
doores were shut. Assoone as these things were scattered
about the citie, by &amp; by there was a great thronging of people.
Amongst whome also came foure monks, dissembling
and fayning, that they knewe not what was there doone,
and therfore they commanded the doores to be opened, and
after asked the Frier howe and after what sorte he came
there. He answered them that he was carried by a spirit.
And moreouer told them what words the image had spoken,
and that he could by no meanes moue out of that place
before that foure of the chiefest Aldermen were come vnto
him, vnto whom he had certaine things to be declared: he
also desired to receiue the holy sacrament. The Aldermen
were foorthwith called, and then the Frier declared vnto
them, how the virgin Mary lamented and sorrowed, for
that the citie of <b><i>Berna</i></b> should be shortly destroyed, for receiuing
yearely penti&#333;s of the French king: Also for that they
droue not the <b>Franciscans</b> out of their citie, who honoured
her with the fayned tytle of vndefiled c&#333;ception. Vnto this
hir talke the Aldermen answered very little. By and by
the other Monkes gaue him the host infected with poyson,
which when he refused to receiue, they brought him an other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which he tooke, then they led him with greate pompe
into the quire, (for so they call the vppermost parte of the
churche.) The Frier &amp; the other foure Monkes were soone
after called before the Aldermen, to testifie the truth whether
those things were so or not. But the foure fearing exceedingly
least he should betray something because they
knew he suspected th&#275;, endeuoured by all meanes to do him
some priuie mischief by poyson giuen in his meate, &amp; therefore
they gaue him the sacrament dipped in poyson, which
he presently cast vp againe by vomit: finally they so vexed
and tormented him by so many wayes, that in the end
he left the Colledge and ran away, and opened the whole
matter to diuers and sundry men. In the meane time the
Monkes dispatched two Legates or messengers to <b>Rome</b>,
to obtaine a confirmation of these things of the Pope,
that hereafter it should be vtterly vnlawfull for any man
to contrary or mislike the same. And when these messengers
were returned, (and as the Prouerbe is) thought
themselues in a safe heauen, the noble Senate had commaunded
the foure Monkes to be fast kept in prison: for
they had learned the whole circumstance of the matter before
of the Frier, whome they had committed to ward. And
sparing neither labour nor mony, sent also vnto <b>Rome</b>,
that they might perfectly knowe, what they should do in
this matter. In the end both the Frier &amp; the foure Monkes
were all put to torments, and there confessed all the matter.
And when they had bin openly conuicte of so many
guiles, and horrible deeds, by the Popes permission they
were first putte from the orders (which they commonly
call degradation) and afterwards burned in the fire.</p>

<p>It was commonly reported, that in case the noble
Senate of <b><i>Berna</i></b> hadde not prosecuted the matter with
great constancie, and courage, the Cleargie woulde haue
cloaked all the knauerie, and haue sette the authors at
libertie. For they had greate cause to doubte, as it after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
came to passe, lest they should loose their credit and authoritie
amongst many of the orders of Monks, and that these
things whereon the Popedome resteth, as it were vpon
pillers, should now be had in great suspition with all men.
For it is most euident, that after the impietie, deceit &amp; wickednesse
of these Monkes began to be knowne abroad, the
opinion of the Cleargie began to decaie, and to be suspected
more and more euery day, of good and godly men: when
as they sayd this or that soule required their helpe: that
tapers lighted of their own accord: that this or that image
spake, wept, or moued it selfe from place to place: that this
or that Saint endowed their monasterie with precious reliques:
or that Crosses were sprinkeled with the blood of
Christ: yea and although they had obteined confirmation
of these matters from the Pope, yet notwithstanding many
afterwards would in no wise bel&eacute;eue it to be so. Likewise
they would not bee perswaded, that this holy father
falling into a traunce, saw any miraculous things: or that
<b>Francis</b> and
<b>Catherin</b> of <b><i>Sena</i></b>,
bare the markes of Christes fiue woundes in their bodie.</p>

<p>Furthermore, not without great cause, men began to
doubt of transubstantiation of bread into the body of Christ,
sith they had so often poysoned the Sacrament: and also of
those things which they chaunted vpon with open mouth,
touching pardons, vigilies, orders, purgatorie, holy water,
and satisfaction. For that we let passe many things, it is
clearer then the daylight, euen by this historie, that many
things haue bene beaten into the peoples heads touching
these foresaid matters, which were only deuised and inuented
by these idle bellies.</p>

</div>
<p class="center"><b>Of a counterfait and deceiuing spirit at <i>Orleance</i> in <i>France</i>.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_as.png" alt="A" width="150" height="160" />
Nd that no man thinke the Friers Preachers
alone to haue bene so bolde, and wicked,
and so readie in deuising so many monsters,
let vs hearken a while to a notable
historie of the <b>Franciscan</b> Friers, reported
by <b>Sleidane</b> in the ninth booke of his Commentaries,
concerning the state of religion and the Common
wealth in the time of <b>Charles</b> the fifth.</p>

<p>In the yeare (saith he) of our Lord <b>1534</b>. the <b>Franciscan</b>
Monkes played a bloodie and deadly pageant at <b><i>Orleaunce</i></b>
in <b><i>France</i></b>. The Maiors wife of the same Citie, when sh&eacute;e
died, commaunded in her will, that she shoulde be buried
without any pompe or noyse, solemnely vsed at that time.
(So also <b>William Bude</b>, a rare and singular ornament of
<b><i>Fraunce</i></b>, lying on his death bedde at <b>Paris</b>, in the yeare of
our Lord 1540. in the month of August, left commaundement
with his friendes to bury him without any great solemnitie
and pompe.) The womans husband, who reuerenced
the memoriall of his wife, did euen as she had willed
him, and because she was buried in the Church of the
<b>Franciscans</b>, besides her father and grandfather, gaue them
in rewarde only sixe Crownes, whereas they hoped for a
farre greater pay. Shortly after, it chaunced that as he felled
certaine woods, and solde them, they desired him to
giue vnto them some parte of it fr&eacute;ely without money:
which hee flatly denied. This they tooke very gr&eacute;euously,
and whereas before they misliked him, they deuised this
meanes to bee reuenged: forsooth to report that his wife
was damned for euer. The chiefe workemen and framers
of this tragedy were <b>Colimannus</b>, and <b>Stephanus Atrebatensis</b>,
both doctors of diuinitie, and <b>Colimannus</b> a great coniurer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hauing all his implements in a readinesse, which he
woonted to vse in such businesse: and thus they handled the
matter. They place ouer the arche of the church a yong nouice:
he about midnight when they came to mumble their
praiers (as they were wont to do) maketh a great rumbling
&amp; noise: out of hand the Monks began to coniure &amp; charme,
but he answereth nothing, then being required to giue a
signe whether he were a dumbe Spirit or no, he begins to
rumble and stir again: which thing they tooke as a certaine
signe. Hauing laid this foundation, they go vnto certain citizens,
chief men and such as fauored them, declaring that a
heauy chaunce had hapned at home, in their monasterie, not
shewing what the matter was, but desiring th&#275; to come to
their mattens at midnight. Wh&#275; those citizens were come
and that praiers were now begun, the counterfeit spirit beginneth
to make a maruellous noise in the top of y&#868; church,
and being asked what he meant, and who he was, he giueth
them signes that it is not lawful for him to speak: Therfore
they commaunde him to make aunswere by tokens and
signes, to certaine things they woulde demaunde of him.
Nowe there was a hole made in the vaute, through the
which he might heare and vnderstand the voyce of the coniurer:
and then had he in his hande a little boord which at
euery question he strake in such sort as he might easily be
heard beneath. First therefore they aske him whether
he were one of them that had bin buried in the same place,
afterwards they reckning vp many by name which had bin
buried there, at the last also name the Maiors wife: and
there by and by, the Spirit gaue the signe that he was her
soule. He was further asked whether he were damned or
no, and if he were, for what desert or fault? Whether for
couetousnesse, or wanton lust, for pride, or want of charitie,
or whether it were for heresie, and for the secte of <b>Luther</b>
newly sprung vp? Also what he meant by that noyse
and sturre he kept there? Whether it were to haue the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bodie now buried in holy ground to be digged vp again, and
to be laide in some other place? To all the which points, he
answered by signes as he was commanded, by the which he
affirmed, or denied any thing, according as he strake the
boord twise or thrise togither. And when he had thus giuen
them to vnderstand, that the very cause of his damnation
was <b>Luthers</b> heresie, and that the bodie must needs be digged
vp againe, the Monkes request the citizens (whose presence
they had vsed) that they would beare witnesse of those
things which they had s&eacute;ene with their eyes, and that they
would subscribe to such things, as were done a fewe dayes
before. The citizens taking good aduise on the matter, least
they should offend the Maior, or bring themselues in trouble,
refuse so to do: but the Monkes notwithstanding take
from thence the sw&eacute;ete bread, which they call the host, and
body of our Lord, togither with all y&#868; reliques of saints, and
cary them to an other place, &amp; there say their Masse. The bishops
substitute iudge (whom they call <b>Officiall</b>) vnderstanding
this matter, commeth thither accompanied with certain
honest men, to y&#868; int&#275;t he might know y&#868; whole circumstances
more exactly, &amp; therfore he c&#333;mandeth them to make
c&#333;iuration in his presence, &amp; also he requireth certaine to be
chosen to go vp to y&#868; top of the vault, and ther to see whether
any ghost appeared or not. That <b>Stephanus Atrebat&#275;sis</b> stifly
denied, and maruellously persuading y&#868; c&#333;trary, affirmed,
that the spirit in no wise ought to be trobled. And albeit the
<b>Officiall</b>, vrged th&#275; very much, y&#877; there might be some coniuring
of the spirit, yet could he nothing preuail. In the mean
while that these things wer a doing, the Maior, wh&#275; he had
shewed the other iustices of the citie, what he wold haue th&#275;
do, tooke his iorny to the king, and opened the whole matter
vnto him. And because the Monks refused iudgement vpon
plea of their owne lawes and liberties: the king choosing
out certaine of the Aldermen of <b><i>Paris</i></b>, giueth them absolute
and full authoritie, to make enquirie on the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The like doth the chancelor, maister <b>Anthonius Pratensis</b>,
Cardinall and Legate for the Pope, throughout <b><i>Fraunce</i></b>.
Therefore when they had no exception to alleadge, they
were conueyed vnto <b><i>Paris</i></b> and there constreyned to make
their aunswere: but yet could nothing be wroong out of
them by confession. Wherevpon they were put a part into
diuers prisons, the Nouice beeing k&eacute;ept in the house of
maister <b><i>Fum&aelig;us</i></b>, one of the Aldermen, who being oftentimes
examined &amp; earnestly requested to vtter the truthe,
woulde notwithstanding confesse nothing, because he feared
that the Monks would afterwards put him to death,
for stayning their order, and putting it to open shame: but
wh&#275; the Iudges had made him sure promise, that he should
escape punishment, and that he should neuer come into
theire handling, he repped vp vnto them the whole matter,
as it was done, and being brought before his fellowes, aduoucheth
the same to their faces. The Monkes albeit they
were by these meanes conuicted, and almost taken tardy
with the d&eacute;ede doing, yet did they refuse the Iudges, bragging
and vaunting them selues on their priuiledges: but al
in vaine: for sentence passed on them, and they were condemned:
that they being caried backe againe to <b><i>Orleaunce</i></b>,
and there cast in prison, should finally be broughte foorth
to the chiefe Church of the citie openly, and from thence
to the place of execution, where they should make open c&#333;fession
of their trespasses. But there chaunced at the very
same time a greeuous persecution against the <b>Lutherans</b>,
which was the cause why that sentence, (albeit was too
gentle for so great an offence) was neuer put in executi&#333;.
For they feared much, because <b>Luthers</b> name was odious
euery where, least if any sharpe iudgement hadde passed,
they should not so muche haue punished the offenders, as
shamed their order: and many supposed that whatsoeuer
had hapned vnto them, would haue bin a pleasant and ioyful
pageaunt and spectacle for the <b>Lutherans</b>. Now the order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the <b>Franciscane</b> Friers, hath the opinion of great
holinesse with the common people: insomuch, that when
they being condemned, were carried to <b><i>Orleaunce</i></b>, certaine
fonde women moued with foolish pittie, followed them to
the very gates of the citie, weeping &amp; sighing abundantly.
When they were come to <b><i>Orleaunce</i></b>, and were there cast
into diuers prisons, againe they vaunted and bare themselues
very brag on their priuiledges, and liberties: and
so at the last when they had lyen long in prison, they were
in the end deliuered without any greater punishment. All
the while they were in prison, they wanted nothing: for
there was bestowed vpon them, especially by women, very
largely, for to serue for their liuing, and to purchase to
them help and fauour. Except these persecutions and troubles,
which we spake of before, had hindred the matter, the
king (as many reported) was fully determined, to haue ouerthrowne
their house, and made it euen with the ground.</p>

<p>This Historie also doth demonstrate and shewe, that
Spirits are not alwayes heard, when some men affirme
they are.</p>

in the Germane Chronicles of the <b>Heluetians</b>,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
A certaine parish Priest of <b><i>Clauenna</i></b>, (whiche is a
Citie neare the Laake or water <b>Larius</b>, in the Countrey of
<b><i>Rhetia</i></b>), being farre in loue with an honest and faire mayden,
the daughter of a citizen in the same town, oftentimes
followed her, as she went vnto her fathers barne: and attempted
to haue defloured her, but she euer resisted, and put
him backe. In the ende when he saw he could not obtaine
his purpose, he priuily stole out of the church a blew cloth,
beset with sundry starres, and therwith couering himselfe,
saue only that he left his armes &amp; f&eacute;ete naked, which he also
berayed with blood, he hideth himselfe without the towne,
and there muffling his face with a thinne linnen cloath,
m&eacute;eteth again with the mayd, fayning himself with a counterfeit
voyce, to be the blessed virgin <b>Mary</b>. Then in many
words he declareth vnto her diuers plages, which were
shortly like to fall on the Citie, for the heresies of <b>Luther</b>,
(for at other times also h&eacute;e had bitterly enueyed against
<b>Luther</b>, in his open Sermons:) he also commaunded the
mayd to shew many things vnto the citizens, touching holy
dayes, fastings, generall processions, &amp;c. And amongst other
things he added, that there was a certain holy and religious
man, whiche had heeretofore asked a thing at her
hands in the very same place, which she had hitherto denied
him, but now it was her pleasure, if he required y&#868; same
again, she should in any wise grant it, if she would attain euerlasting
life: and y&#877; aboue all thing, she must conceale and
k&eacute;ep close this latter point vnto her self. The mayd&#275; by &amp; by
blazed it about al the citie, that our Lady had visibly appeared
vnto her, &amp; foretold her of sundry plagues likely to happen
vnto the citie. The inhabitants taking good aduise on
this matter, at the last for feare of these imminent dangers
and plages, gaue commandement, that three daies shuld be
kept holy. In the which time, the mayd, supposing she shuld
do high seruice to the virgin <b>Mary</b>, fulfilleth the lust of that
wicked knaue. This trecherie and deceit being shortly after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
detected by the wonderfull prouidence of God, the varlet
was first beheaded, and afterward burnt in fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Erasmus.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Spectrum.</div>

<p><b>Erasmus Roterodamus</b>, writeth in his two and twentieth
booke of Epistles, vnto a certaine Bishop, excusing himself,
touching certaine points, which he had moued vnto him,
to the ende he should be very circumspect: and amongst other
things, making mention there of spirits or wandring
soules, he reporteth this Historie. There was (saith he)
a certaine parish Priest, who had dwelling with him in
his house, a N&eacute;ece of his, a woman well stored with money:
In whose Chamber hee woulde oftentimes conuey
himselfe, being disguised in a sh&eacute;ete lyke vnto a Spirite:
And then he cast foorth a doubtfull voyce, hoping that the
woman would either procure a coniurer for her helpe, or
else her selfe make him answere. But she hauing a man-like
courage, priuily requesteth one of her friendes to
lodge in her Chamber secretly all night. The man being
armed with a clubbe insteed of other coniuring tooles,
and being well tippled with drinke, to auoyd feare, hideth
himselfe in the bedde. Sodainly commeth the Spirit roaring
very miserably: The coniurer with his clubbe awaketh,
leapeth out of his bedde scant sober, and setteth vpon
him. Then the Spirit with his voyce and iesture, beginneth
to make him afrayd. But the drunken coniurer soone
answered him: If (quoth he) thou be the Diuel, I am thy
mother: and therewith catching holde on him, all to beat
him with his club, and would also haue slaine him, if he had
not chaunged his voyce, and cryed; O spare me for Gods
sake, I am no soule, but I am sir Iohn. Which voyce when
the woman heard and knewe, she leapes out of her bedde,
and parts the fraye, &amp;c. The same <b>Erasmus</b> writeth in the
foresayd Epistle, that this Priest vpon Easter eue, put liue
crabbes priuily into the churchyard, hauing waxe candles
on light cleauing to their sides: which when they crawled
amongst the graues, s&eacute;emed to bee suche a terrible sight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that no man durst approach n&eacute;ere them. Hereof rose a fearfull
reporte, wherewith all men b&eacute;eing amazed, the priest
declareth to y&#868; people in the pulpit, that they were y&#868; soules
of deade men which desired to be deliuered out of their torments
by Masses &amp; almes d&eacute;eds. This deceite was espied
by these meanes: that at the last one or two of the crabbes
were found amongst the rubbish, hauing the candles done
out cleauing on their backs, which y&#868; priest had not tak&#275; vp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Georgius Buchananus.</div>

<p><b>Georgius Buchananus</b>, prince of all Poets in this our
age, reporteth an historie in his Commodie called <b>Franciscanus</b>,
of one <b>Langus</b> a priest, who falsly affirming that in a
field of Scotland full of Brimstone there were soules miserablie
tormented, which continually cried for helpe and
succour, suborned a countrie clowne whome he would coniure,
as if he had bin one of those soules. Which deceite of
his, y&#868; husbandm&#257; afterward discouered wh&#275; he was drunk.
I would here repeate his verses, but that his bookes are
nowe in euery mans hands. While I was writing these
things, it was reported vnto me by credible persons, that
in <b>Augusta</b>, a noble citie of Germanie, this present yeare
1569. there was a maide and certaine other men seruants
in a great mans family, which little regarded the sect of the
<b>Iesuite</b> Friers: &amp; that one of the saide order made promise
to their master, that he wold easily bring them to an other
opinion: &amp; so disguising himselfe like vnto a Diuel, was
hid in a priuie corner of y&#868; house: vnto the which place, one
of the maides going, either of hir owne accorde to fetche
some thing, or being sent by her master, was by y&#868; disguised
Iesuite made maruellously afraide: which thing she
presently declared vnto one of the m&#275; seruants exhorting
him in any wise to take h&eacute;ede of the place. Who shortly
after going to the same place, &amp; laying hold on his dagger,
sodeynly stabbed in the counterfeit diuell, as he came
rushing on him. This history is written in Duch verses,
and put in print, and now almost in euery mans hands.</p>

<p class="center"><b>That it is no maruell if vaine sightes haue bene in old time,<br />
neither yet that it is to be maruelled at, if there be any at<br />
this day.</b></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambition.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAny other like examples might be brought, but these
may suffise to proue euidently, to what point ambition,
couetousnesse, enuy, hatred, stubburnesse, idlenesse
and loue, do most commonly driue men.</p>

<p>We s&eacute;e by common experience, that proude ambitious
men dare aduenture any thing. If they may hurt or hinder
other men by accusations, slanders, or any other wayes
or meanes, whome they suppose may preiudice or let their
exalting to honour, they sticke not at all to doo it. What
maruell is it then that Monkes and Priests, which desire
to be aloft, indeuour now a daies to purchase vnto themselues
authoritie by false miracles, vaine apparitions, and
such other like trumpery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Couetousnesse.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Paule.</div>

<p>All men know what a pernitious thing couetousnesse
is. For they which are not contented to liue with a litle,
but will n&eacute;eds be rich, neither care for any man, nor yet
spare any man. Hungry guttes s&eacute;eke sundrie wayes to fill
themselues: fewe willingly endure hunger. Wherefore
it is not be maruelled at, if amongst Monks and Priests
at these our dayes, who haue bene euer reported to be couetous,
there be some founde, which by false apparitions of
soules, s&eacute;eke their gaines, inuenting holy pilgrimages, and
other baytes to get mony. For what wil not idle and slothfull
lubbers attempt to purchase riches? Doth not Saint
<b>Paule</b> say, that those which will
waxe rich by idlenesse, fall into the snares of the Diuell?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enuis.</div>

<p>Emulation, wilfulnesse, enuie, hatred, contention, desire
to ouercome, what they may doo, what they may bring
to passe, daily experience teacheth vs. The Preachers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<b><i>Berna</i></b>, when they perceiued they could not ouercome their
aduersaries by any other means, y&eacute;elded themselues (which
is horrible to be spoken) vnto the diuel, making him one of
their counsell. And who can deny but y&#868; priests now adayes
are also for the most part, stubborne, and full of contention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Idlenesse.</div>

<p>Idlenesse is the nurse and mother of all mischiefe: what
goodnesse then may ye looke for of them, which not only exercise
themselues in no labours prescribed by God, neither
yet apply themselues to good learning, but day and night
play the gluttons? Tell me I pray th&eacute;e, whether the laboring
husbandman, or the idle man, who alwayes spent his
time in inuenting pernitious mischiefes, first founde out
those cruel instruments of warre which they call gunnes?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loue.</div>

<p>It might be declared in many words what loue is able
to do. Now because Monks and Priests liue idlely, abounding
in all wantonnesse, and yet are restrained from holy
marriage, what maruell is it if at this time also they faine
and counterfeit many visions, that they might thereby the
easier enioy their loue? And here I wil not say it is to be
feared, that there are many amongst them so wicked and
villanous, as to exercise &amp; practise magicall Artes, and such
like, which are vtterly forbidden. Who can then maruell
hereafter, if it be sayd, they counterfeyt spirites, affirming
they haue let men see this or that soule? For in what men
soeuer these vices be, which we haue rehearsed, surely those
dare boldly aduenture any thing.</p>

<p>No kinde of men are more obnoxious to these kinde of
things, than those which leade their life in Monasteries,
and Colledges: and therefore no man ought to maruell or
thinke it a straunge thing, if we say that in times past many
false visions haue bene practised, and may also at this day
likewise happen. For y&#868; world, as all men iustly complaine,
waxeth worse and worse. Men are now more impudent,
more bold, more couetous, and more wicked, than euer they
were in times past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreouer, the Cleargie of <b><i>Rome</i></b> haue in many places
this prerogatiue aboue others, that most men (especially
such as are led by superstition) make much of them, worshipping
them with great reuerence, no man so much as
suspecteth them to apply their mindes to euill matters, to
subtiltie, craft, and deceit: all men looke for other things at
their hands. If therefore they addict themselues to euill deuises,
they may easily deceiue men, except God miraculously
reueale their wickednesse, and bring it to light, as we
declared in a fewe examples rehearsed before.</p>

<p>And perchance for this cause also, Priests and Monkes
could not bee so well blamed, for their so often deceiuing
plaine meaning folkes with craft and subtiltie, in so much
as some of their moste holy Fathers, I meane Popes of
<b><i>Rome</i></b>, haue bin very cunning in magicall sciences, as their
owne Historiographers affirme, and by meanes of those
artes, haue aspired to the high top of Popedome. <b>Beno</b> (or
rather <b>Bruno</b>, for so I iudge his name is) who was also a
Cardinall, set foorth the life of Pope <b>Gregorie</b> the seuenth,
in writing, in the which h&eacute;e sheweth the sayd Bishop to
haue bene a proude, arrogant, malicious and couetous
Monke, and that h&eacute;e was throughly s&eacute;ene in the blacke
art of Negromancie. <b>Bartholomeus Platina</b> (who being
a sworne seruant with the Pope, excusing their faults as
much as he can) writeth of <b>Siluester</b> the second, y&#877; he gaue
himselfe to the diuel, and that by his meanes, his counsell
&amp; magical deuises, he atteined y&#868; great office of papacie. Doo
ye think, that it is a hard thing for him y&#877; is confederat with
the enemy of mankind, to faine spirits &amp; soules, or to c&#333;iure
a diuel, to make men bel&eacute;eue he were a soule, do you thinke
such men abhorre to doo such mischiefe? The <b>Historiographers</b>
report that <b>Bonifacius</b> the 8. deceiued his predecessor
<b>Celestinus</b>, by a voyce sent through a cane r&eacute;ed, as though it
had come from heauen, perswading him to giue ouer his
office of Popeship, and to institute therein, one <b>Bonifacius</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a worthier man than he, except he would be thrust out
of the kingdome of heauen. The poore simple Pope obeying
this voyce, ordeined <b>Bonifacius</b> Pope in his steade, in the
yeare of our Lord 1294. who first brought in the yeare of
Iubile. Of this <b>Boniface</b>, the common people would say,
<b><i>He came in like a Fox, he raigned like a wolfe, and died like
a Dog</i></b>. If the very vicar of Christ, who hath all knowledge
as it were fast lockt in the Coffer of his brest, could
be deceiued, lette no man maruel any more if simple credulous
husbandmen and citezens haue ben deceiued, and
that it hath bin said to them: God spake this: This soule
did aske helpe: and such like things, which are most false
and vaine. Yf this man coulde counterfeit the voyce of
God, coulde he not also faine the voice of dead men?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sometimes

the

<p>Before I proc&eacute;ede any further, this is also to be obserued,
that plesaunt conceited fellowes, may oftentimes deceiue
the priests, themselues. For when the priests did
brag, that they coulde coniure Spirits and deliuer mens
soules, it may be that other being wrapped in sh&eacute;ets, hauing
vnderneth them liue coales in an earthen pot, appeared
vnto priests, who by and by were persuaded they sawe
saules which required their helpe to be deliuered. <b>Erasmus</b>
in his <b>Colloquio</b> or talke which he intituled <b>Exorcismus,
vel spectrum</b>, or a coniuration or vision, writeth howe one
<b>Polus</b> maruellously deceiued a
priest called <b>Faustus</b>. But
there is no doubt but that priests being many times deceiued
in iest by the lay men for pastimes sake, haue on the
other side more often times beguiled them in earnest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Men walking

<p>I haue spoken hitherto of men being awake, and now
I will adde a fewe words of such as sl&eacute;epe. There be many
which haue such a kinde of disease, that they walke in
their sl&eacute;epe: which thing we reade to haue bin true in one

and in <b>Pericles</b> seruant, who in their

some which in their sl&eacute;epe haue done that which b&eacute;eing awake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
they could not do by any meanes. If a man s&eacute;e such
a one walking in the night, either apparrelled or naked,
and after here him say he was at the same time in his bed,
he will straight thinke, it was his soule that he sawe, the
like will he do if he heare such a one at his owne house.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><b>That many naturall things are taken to be ghoasts.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_ts.png" alt="T" width="150" height="164" /></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fayries of the
earth.</div>

<p>Here happen daily many things by the ordinary
course of nature, which diuers men,
especially they that are timorous and fearefull,
suppose to be visions or spirits. As for
example, when they heare the crying of
ratts, catts, weasels, martins, or any other
beaste, or when they heare a horse beate his f&eacute;ete on the
plankes in the stable at midnight, by and by they sweat for
feare, supposing some bugges to walke in the dead of the
night. Somtimes a bittour, or hearne (which birds are sildome
s&eacute;ene with vs in <b><i>Germany</i></b>) or some other straunge
birds, make a noise in the aire: many fooles straightwayes
dreame, they haue heard I wotte not what. If a worme
which fretteth wood, or that br&eacute;edeth in tr&eacute;es, chaunce
to gnawe a wall of waynescot, or other timber, many will
iudge they heare one softly knocking vppon an anduill
with a sledge: and sometimes they imagine they heare many
hammers at one time. Simple foolish men hearing these
things, imagine, I know not how, that there be certaine
elues or fairies of the earth, and tell many straunge and
maruellous tales of them, which they haue heard of their
grandmothers and mothers, how they haue appeared vnto
those of the house, haue done seruice, haue rocked the
cradle, and (which is a signe of good lucke) do continually
tarry in the house. If such dwarfes or elues haue bene s&eacute;ene
at any time, surely they were euill spirits. For we reade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that the Gentiles in time past, had their familiar or houshold
gods, whome they worshipped with great deuotion,
because (as they thought) they tooke care of their house, and
defended their family: and vnto these men, euil spirits did
sometimes appeare, thereby to confirme them the more in
their blinde superstition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olaus Magnus.</div>

<p><b>Olaus Magnus</b> Archbishop of <b><i>Vpsalia</i></b>, writeth in his history
<b>de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</b>, that euen at this day
also, there are spirits s&eacute;ene in these countries, which hauing
the shape of men, do men seruice in the night, dressing their
horse, and looking to their cattell. The winde in the night,
ouerthroweth some thing, or shaketh a casement or lid of
the window: many by and by thinke they s&eacute;e a spirite, and
can very hardly be brought from that vaine opinion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Echo.</div>

<p>This thing is also according to nature, that when a man
either crieth or speaketh in the woods, valies, or other hollow
places, <b>Echo</b> wil resound the later word or sillable, so
plainly many times, that a man would verily thinke some
liuing bodie made him answere againe. Many would be afraide
hereof at all times, but especially in the night season,
except he knew very well it were a naturall thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardanus.</div>

<p><b>Cardanus</b> in his booke <b>de Subtilitate lib. 18.</b> rehearseth a
maruellous historie of one <b>Comensis</b>, who very late in the
night, comming to a riuersside, not knowing where he
might passe ouer, called out aloude for some bodie to shewe
him the foorde, and when the <b>Echo</b> made him answere, hee
supposing it to be a man, asked him if he might passe ouer
here: to whom the <b>Echo</b> answered again in y&#868; Italian tong,
Here, here. But in y&#877; place was a whirlpoole, and a great roring
of the water: Therfore y&#868; man douting, asketh once or
twice againe, whether the riuer might be past ouer in the
same place: to which the <b>Echo</b> answered stil that it might.
In the end, when he had escaped y&#868; passage without danger,
he told his friends, how by the persuasi&#333; of the diuel, he had
almost throwne himself hedlong into the riuer, and drowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
himself. In the same place, he saith, that the great Hall
at <b>Ticinium</b> in <b><i>Italy</i></b>, doth render sundry and manifold voyces,
if one speake in it, and that the voyces as it were die
and make an end much lyke a mans voyce, when he lyeth
a dying, in so much that a man can scant be perswaded it is
the noyse of <b>Echo</b>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Things shyning
by night.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hector Boethius.</div>

<p>There are certain things which shine only in the night,
as some precious stones doo, the eyes of certaine beastes, a
Glowoorme, or Globard, as also some kinde of rotten wood,
wherewith many times children so terrifie their play-fellowes,
that they imagine with themselues, to s&eacute;e euil spirites,
or men all burning with fire. <b>Hector Boethius</b> writeth,
that a certain King of Scots caused some of his men to
be disguised in garments with bright shining scales, hauing
in their hands rotten wood inst&eacute;ed of staues, and so to
appeare to his nobilitie and Lords in the night, exhorting
them to fight couragiously with their enemies, and promising
them to obtaine victorie. Whereby the noble men supposing
they had s&eacute;ene angels, behaued themselues valiantly,
and atchieued the victorie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burning lights.</div>

<p>Many times candles &amp; small fires appeare in the night,
and s&eacute;eme to runne vp and downe. And as the yong men in <b><i>Heluetia</i></b>,
who with their firebrands which they light, at the
bonfires in Shroftide, sometime gather themselues togither,
and then scatter abroad, and againe, m&eacute;eting togither,
march in a long rancke: euen so doo those fires sometime
s&eacute;eme to come togither, and by and by to be seuered &amp; runne
abroad, and at the last to vanish cleane away. Sometime
these fires goe alone in the night season, and put such as s&eacute;e
them, as they trauell by night, in great feare. But these
things, and many such lyke haue their naturall causes:
and yet I will not deny, but that many times Diuels delude
men in this maner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exhalatons.</div>

<p>Natural Philosophers write, that thicke exhilations
aryse out of the earth, and are kindled. Mynes full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of sulphur and brimstone, if the aire enter vnto it, as it lyeth
in the holes and veines of the earth, will kindle on fier,
and striue to get out. Sometimes fire bursteth out of
the earth, as high as a tall tr&eacute;e, and is suddeinly put out againe.
Which thing is to be thought to proc&eacute;ede of fierie
matter, s&eacute;eking a vent to gush out. Wee reade of the
mount <b><i>Aetna</i></b> in
<b><i>Cicilie</i></b>, that in times past it burnt continually,
day and night, casting forth flames of fire, fiery stones
and ashes in great aboundance. The lyke is read also at
<b><i>Vesuuius</i></b> a hill in <b><i>Campaine</i></b>, about a Germaine mile from
<b><i>Naples</i></b>: The same hill in the time of <b>Titus</b> the Emperour,
as S. <b>Hierom</b> reporteth, cast foorth of it so much fire, that it
burnt the country, and cities, and people rounde about it,
and filled the fieldes adioyning full of cinders and ashes.
These two hilles, euen in our dayes boyling with great
heate, haue very much indamaged the people inhabiting
thereabout. In <b><i>Iseland</i></b>, as <b>Olaus Magnus</b> witnesseth, are
found fiers which breake out of the earth. And as whole
hilles and mountaines may burne, euen so may a litle fire
be kindled in the earth, and yet wander very large. They
which trauelling by the way, or by some other meanes
chaunce to s&eacute;e these things, and know not the naturall causes
of them, imagin by reason of feare, that they haue s&eacute;ene
men burning like fire, or some other straunge thing, which
they haue heard other men talke of. And by means of their
great feare, oftentimes they fall into great daungerous
diseases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glasses.</div>

<p>The arte perspectiue doth also worke this wonderfull
feate, that diuers and sundrie shapes will appeare in glasses,
made and sette togither aftter a certeine artificial sorte:
sometimes they will s&eacute;eme to goe out of the doores, and resemble
men of our familiar acquaintance. Many things in
very d&eacute;ed are naturall, although we cannot finde any naturall
reason for them.</p>

<p>And yet by the way, they shewe themselues too foolishe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which labour to bring all things to natural causes. Here I
will say nothing of these men, which can beare plaine and
rude people in hande, that they, or some other of their acquaintance,
haue s&eacute;ene strange things, which they earnestly
auouch to be true, when as ind&eacute;ede there was no suche
thing. How often I pray you, do we heare things affirmed
as true, which afterward proue most false: as that one was
caried away bodie and soule, that an other was put to death,
and an infinit nomber of such like reports.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><b>A proofe out of the Gentiles histories, that Spirites and<br />
Ghoasts do oftentimes appeare.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">ALbeit many melancholicke, madde, fearefull, and
weake sensed men, doo oftentimes imagine many
things which in very d&eacute;ed are not, and are likewise
deceiued, sometime by men, or by brute beasts: and
moreouer mistake things which proc&eacute;ede of naturall causes,
to be bugges and spirites, as I haue hitherto declared
by many examples, yet it is most certaine and sure,
that all those things which appeare vnto men are not alwayes
naturall things, nor alwayes vaine terrors to affray
men: but that spirites doo often appeare, and many
straunge and maruellous things doo sundry times chance.
For many such things of this sort, are to be red in diuers
graue and auncient Historiographers: and many men of
no small credite, haue affirmed, that they haue s&eacute;ene spirites
both in the day and in the night also. And here I will
orderly declare a fewe histories out of diuers allowed authors,
touching spirites which haue appeared and shewed
themselues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triton appeared
to Iulius
Cæsar.</div>

<p><b>Suetonius Tranquillus</b> writeth, that when <b>Iulius Cæsar</b>
marching out of <b><i>Fraunce</i></b> into <b><i>Italie</i></b> with his army, and
comming to the riuer <b><i>Rubico</i></b>, which diuideth <b><i>Italie</i></b> from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the hether <b><i>Fraunce</i></b>, staying there a while, and reuoluing
with himselfe howe great an enterprise hee had taken in
hand, as he was wauering in mind whether he shuld passe
the water or not, suddeinly there appeared a man of excelling
stature and shape sitting hard by, pyping on a r&eacute;ede.
(<b>Melancthon</b> in his Phisickes calleth him <b>Triton</b>) vnto
whom when not only shepheards, but also very many souldiers
from the campe, and amongst them diuers trumpetters
had flocked to heare him, he sodeinly snatched a trumpet
from one of them, and leaped to the riuer, and with a
lustie breath blowing vp the alarum, went to the farther
side. Then sayd <b>Cæsar</b>, good lucke mates, let vs goe whither
the gods warnings leade vs, and whither our enemies
iniquitie calleth vs: The dice are throwne. And so
he transported ouer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theseus seene
in the battaile
of Maratho.</div>

<p><b>Plutarke</b> writeth in <b>Theseus</b> life, that many which
were in the battaile of <b>Marathonia</b>, against the <b>Medians</b>,
did affirme, that they sawe the soule of <b>Theseus</b> armed,
(who long time before died of a fall) before the vauntgard
of the <b>Grecians</b>, running and setting on the barbarous <b>Medians</b>.
For which cause the <b>Athenians</b> afterward were moued
to honor him as a demigod.</p>

<p><b>Pausanias</b> writeth in <b>Atticis</b>,
That in the field of <b>Maratho</b>.
400. yeares after the battaile there foughten, there
was heard the neying of Horses, and the encountring of
souldiers, as it were fighting euery night: And that they
which of purpose came to heare these things, could heare
nothing, but those that by chaunce came that way, heard it
very sensibly.</p>

<p>The same <b>Plutarke</b> writeth in the life of <b>Cimon</b>, that
when the citizens of <b>Cherouesus</b>, had by faire words called
home their captaine <b>Damon</b>, (who before for diuers
murthers departed the citie) afterwards they cruelly slew
him in a Hotehouse, as he was bathing himselfe, and from
that time foorth, there were many strange sightes s&eacute;ene in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the same place, &amp; many times also most gr&eacute;euous gronings
were there heard, insomuch that they were euer after constreined
to stop vp the hotehouse doores.</p>

<p>Also in y&#868; life of <b>Dion</b>, he reporteth that the saide <b>Dion</b>
being a stoute &amp; a couragious man without any feare, sawe
notwithstanding a great and maruellous horrible sight.
For when he chaunced to sit alone in the entry of his house
in the euening (those are <b>Plutarks</b> owne words, as <b>Xiliander</b>
interpreteth them) musing &amp; discoursing many things
with himselfe, being sodeinly moued with a great noyse,
he arose and looked backe to the other side of the gallerie,
and there he espied a monstrous great woman, who in apparell
and countenaunce nothing differing from a Tragi,
call furie, swept the house with a broome. With the which
sight being amazed &amp; terribly afraide, he called his friends
and acquaintance vnto him, and declaring vnto them what
he had s&eacute;ene, desired th&#275; to remaine with him al that night:
for b&eacute;eing as it were stricken dead with feare, he doubted
least it would appeare vnto him againe, if he were alone,
which ind&eacute;ede neuer hapned after. But a fewe daies after,
his sonne threwe himselfe headlong from the top of the
house, and died, and he himselfe being stabbed through the
bodie, ended his miserable life.</p>

<p>The same author writeth in the life of <b>Decius Brutus</b>,
how when <b>Brutus</b> was determined to transporte his army
out of <b>Asia</b> into <b>Europe</b>, being in his tent about midnight,
the candle burning dimly, and all the host quiet and silent,
as he was musing and reuoluing with himselfe, he s&eacute;emed
that he hearde one entring the Tente into him, and looking
backe vnto the doore, he sawe a terrible and monstrous
shape of a bodie, which farre exc&eacute;eded the common
stature of men, standing faste by him without any
words, wherewith he was sore afraid: and yet he ventured
to aske it this question. What art thou (saieth
h&eacute;e) either a God, or a man? and why commest thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
vnto me? Whereto the image answered: I am (quoth he)
O <b>Brutus</b>, thy euill ghoast, at <b>Philippos</b> thou shalt s&eacute;e m&eacute;e.
Then saith <b>Brutus</b>, being nothing amazed: I will s&eacute;e th&eacute;e.
When the sight was vanished, he called his seruants, who
tolde him, that they neither sawe any such thing, neither
heard any voyce at all. All that night <b>Brutus</b> could not sl&eacute;ep
one winke. In the morning very early, he goeth vnto <b>Cassius</b>
and sheweth him his straunge vision. <b>Cassius</b> who despised
all such things (for he was an Epicure) ascribed the
whole matter to naturall causes. For his disputation hereof,
is yet extant in <b>Plutarke</b>. Afterwards <b>Brutus</b> (being vanquished
by <b>Augustus</b>, and <b>Anthony</b>, in the field of <b>Philippi</b>)
slew himselfe because he would not bee deliuered into the
hands of his enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caius Cassius
sawe Iulius
Cæsar.</div>

<p><b>Valerius Maximus</b>, in his first booke and sixt chap. writeth
that <b>Caius Cassius</b> sawe <b>Iulius Cæsar</b> in the battaile of
<b>Philippi</b>, (in a shape of greater maiesty, than any man hath)
setting spurres to his horse, and running on him with a terrible
threatning countenance: which when <b>Cassius</b> sawe,
he turned his backe to the enemy, and fled, and shortly after
murthered himselfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drusus sawe a
woman excelling
all mortall
creatures
in maiestie.</div>

<p><b>Dio Cassius Nicæsus</b>, in his Roman historie from the beginning
of his 55.booke writeth of <b>Drusus</b>, who by spoyling
<b><i>Germany</i></b> far and n&eacute;ere on euery side, came euen to the riuer
<b>Albis</b>, where when he could not get ouer, erecting monuments
of victorie, departed back againe: For he there saw
a woman, exc&eacute;eding the state of mortall creatures, which
met him, and sayd vnto him: <b>Drusus</b>, which canst finde no
end of thy gr&eacute;edie desire, whither goest thou? It is not lawfull
for th&eacute;e to s&eacute;e al these things: but rather get th&eacute;e hence,
for the ende both of thy life and worthie d&eacute;edes is nowe at
hand. When <b>Drusus</b> heard these things, he sodeinly chaunged
his course, and being on his iourney, before he came to
the riuer of <b>Rein</b>, he sickned and dyed. Other like foretokens
the same author reporteth to haue hapned before his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
death, all the which notwithstanding, he nothing regarded.
For two yong men appeared on horsebacke vpon the
rampiers, and the shriking of women was also hearde,
with many other such like. &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plinius secundus
writing of
spirits.</div>

<p><b>Plinius secundus</b> citizen of <b>Nouocomensis</b>, hath an Epistle
of Spirits appearings, written vnto his friend <b>Sura</b>
in the vii. booke of his Epistles, which we haue thought
good to set downe whole in this place: Leisure (saith he)
graunteth me libertie to learne, and giueth th&eacute;e leaue to
teache. Therfore I am very desirous to knowe whether
thou thinke fantasies are any thing, and whether they
haue any proper figure of their owne, and be some kinde
of diuine power, or else whether they take vppon them
some vaine &amp; variable shape, according to the feare which
we haue of them? That I should so bel&eacute;eue, I am especially
moued thereto by that which I heare saie happened
to <b>Curtius Rufus</b>, who was as then, companion to the
Proconsul of <b>Affrica</b>, bothe poore, and also of small reputation.
And as he walked one day in a Gallerie towardes
the euening their m&eacute;eteth with him the shape of a woman,
more great &amp; beautifull, than any liuing creature. Wherat
he b&eacute;eing amazed, she telleth him that she is <b><i>Affrica</i></b>, and
is come vnto him to foretell him of good happe to followe:
First that he should go to Rome, and there take on him
the state of great honoure, and afterwarde, that he should
returne into the same prouince with full and high authoritie,
and there end his daies. Which things came all to
passe. And moreouer, the same figure (as it is saide) mette
with him againe on the shore side, as he entred out of the
ship, and came towardes <b><i>Carthage</i></b> to take his charge and
regiment in hande. Afterwards falling sick, when no man
dispayred of his healthe, coniecturing things to come by
those that had passed, and comparing aduersitie with his
former prosperitie, he vtterly cast away all hope of recouerie.
Is not this also more terrible, and no lesse maruellous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
whiche I will now repeate as I haue heard it
tolde?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spirit of
Athens.</div>

<p>There was in <b><i>Athens</i></b> a goodly and a very large house,
but euill reported, and counted as an infortunate and vnluckie
house. For about midnight, there was heard the
noyse of iron, and if one marked it well, the ratling of
chaines, as it were a farre off at the first, and so, n&eacute;erer and
n&eacute;erer: shortly there appeared an image or shape, as it were
an olde man, leane and loathsome to beholde, with a long
beard and staring haire: on his legges he had fetters, and
in his hands carried chaines which he alwaies ratled togither.
By meanes whereof, those that inhabited the house,
by reason of their feare, watched many heauie and pittifull
nights: after their watching folowed sicknesse, and soone after,
as feare increased, ensued death. For in the day time
also, albeit the image were departed, yet the remembrance
thereof, was euer present before their eyes: so that their
feare was longer than they had cause to feare. Vpon this
the house stood desert and solitarie, wholly lefte vnto the
monster whiche haunted it: yet was it proclaimed to be
solde, if happily any man whiche was ignorant of this
great mischiefe, would either buy it or hire it. <b>Athenodorus</b>
chanced to come to <b><i>Athens</i></b>, and there readeth the writing
on the doore: And when he had learned the price, because
he suspected the good cheapenesse thereof, enquiring
further, vnderstoode the whole matter, and notwithstanding
any thing that he heard, he hired the house, so
much the rather. When it waxed night, he commaundeth
his seruauntes to make his bedde in the vtter part
of the house: he taketh his writing tables, his writing wier
and a candle, and sendeth all his seruaunts into the inner
part of the house. He himselfe setleth his minde, his eyes
and hand to write, least his mind being vnoccupied, should
imagine it heard straunge figures, and should br&eacute;ed vaine
feare. In the beginning of the night, there was silence as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is in all other places, but not long after the iron began to
ring, and the chaines to moue: but yet he would not looke
vp, nor let cease his writing, but hardned his hart, and stopped
his eares. Then the noyse increaseth &amp; draweth neare,
and s&eacute;emeth sometimes to be without the porch, sometimes
within. Th&#275; he looketh back, and seeth and acknowledgeth
the shape whereof he had heard before: the image stood still
and beckned with his finger as though he had called him,
the philosopher on the other side signifieth with his hand,
that he should stay a while, and falleth againe to his writing.
The image shaketh his chaines ouer his head, as he
sate writing. He looketh about againe, and seeth him beckning,
as he did before. And so rising vp without delay, taketh
the candle in his hand and foloweth: the image goeth
before with a softly pace, as though he were heauily laden
with chaines: After he had turned aside into the court of
the house, sodeinly vanishing away, leaueth his walking
mate alone. He being forsaken, laieth hearbes and leaues
gathered togither vpon the place. The next day he goeth to
the rulers of the citie, and willeth them to commaund the
place to b&eacute;e digged vp, whiche done, they finde bones
wrapped and tyed in chaynes: which the bodie b&eacute;eing
putrified and consumed with long lying in the earth, had
left lying in bondes: those bones being gathered togither,
were buried solemnely: The house, after they were orderly
laide in the ground, was euer after cleare of all such
ghostes.</p>

<p>In these things I must bel&eacute;eue other mens reports, but
that which followeth, I can boldly affirme on mine owne
knowledge.</p>

<p>I haue one with m&eacute;e, sometime my bondseruaunt,
but nowe enfraunchized and set at libertie, a man not vtterly
vnlearned: with him my yonger brother lay togither
in one bed. He in his owne imagination seemed that he saw
a certain personage sitting vpon the bedde where he laie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
putting kniues vnto his head, and therewith polling off his
haires. When it was day light, the haires were found on
the ground, he being in very d&eacute;ed notted about the crowne
of his head. Shortly after the like happened vnto him,
which made all men bel&eacute;eue the first was true. The boy
amongst a great many of his fellowes chaunced to sl&eacute;epe
in the schoole, and being in sl&eacute;epe, there came certaine in at
the windowes (as he sayd) cloathed in white garments,
and shore of his haire as he laie, and so departed againe as
they came. This polling, and also his haires scattered
abroad, were founde when it was day. No notable matter
ensued hereof, except it were, perchaunce, that I was
not accused of treason, as I should haue bene, if <b>Domitianus</b>,
who died about this time, had liued longer. For there
was a libell found in his coffers, giuen vnto him against
me, written by maister <b>Carus</b>. By which it may well be
coniectured, that in so much as those which are accused, doo
vse to let their haire growe very long, the cutting of my
friends haire, was a sure signe of escaping the great daunger,
which then hung ouer my head. Wherefore I hartily
require you to straine your learning. The matter is worthie,
wherein ye may vse long and d&eacute;epe consideration: and
I surely am vnworthie to whom ye shuld open your knowledge.
You may therfore (if it please you) dispute the matter
on both sides, as ye are accustomed, but yet I pray you handle
it more throughly on the one side, least ye sende me away
wauering and hanging in doubt, whereas the cause of
my s&eacute;eking counsel, is to the ende I might be quite out of
doubt. Fare ye well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> Manlius.</div>

<p>What answere master <b>Sura</b>, (who as it appeareth, was
well learned) made vnto maister <b>Pliny</b> I do not finde. But
to say the truth, what sound answere could he, being a Gentile
make herein? The like history is to be red in the collections
of <b>Iohn Manlius</b> common places, who (as <b>Philip Melancthon</b>
reporteth) dooth write, that <b>Theodorus Gaza</b>

had a lordship or manour place in <b><i>Campania</i></b>, giuen him by
<b>Nicholas</b> Pope of <b><i>Rome</i></b>. In the manour, when by chaunce,
one of his farmers had digged vp a coffin with dead mens
bones in it, there sodeinly appeared a spirit vnto him, commaunding
him to bury the coffin againe, or else his sonne
should shortly after die. Which when the farmer refused
to doo, shortly after his sonne was found slaine in the night.
A fewe dayes after, the Spirit appeared againe vnto the
husbandman, menacing and threatning him, that in case
he did not bury the aforesaid bones, he would kill his other
sonne also. The man taking warning by his losse, and s&eacute;eing
his other sonne fallen sicke, goeth vnto maister <b>Theodorus</b>
and sheweth him all the matter. He vnderstanding
it, goeth with him to the manour, and there in the same
place where the farmer had before digged vp the coffin,
casting a new graue, they bury the coffin with the bones.
As soone as the bones were laide in the graue, the husbandmans
sonne immediatly recouered his health.</p>

out of the house, where he had taken vp his Inne, in the

of thr&eacute;e days before he was slaine by a thrust, sawe a certaine
shadow in one of his fishponds, which with a sworde
readie drawne threatened to slaie him, and thereby much
disquieted him.</p>

<p><b>Flauius Vopiscus</b> writeth, that whereas <b>Tacitus</b> fathers
graue opened it selfe, the sides therof falling downe of their

it was a most sure and infallible signe, that he should die
shortly after.</p>

of <b>Constantius</b> death, saith that he was troubled

and terrified in the night season with shapes and figures.</p>

<p>The same Author affirmeth in his 25. booke, that a little
before <b>Iulianus</b> died, as he sate writing in the tents, following
the example of <b>Iulius Cæsar</b>, he sawe the image of the

<div class="sidenote">Sozomenus.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF we read ouer the Ecclesiasticall histories, we shall
finde many of these examples. <b>Sozomenus</b> writeth in his
Ecclesiasticall historie, the sixt booke and 28. chapter, of one
<b>Apelles</b>, a black Smyth by occupation (whose name was at
that time very famous throughout <b><i>Egipt</i></b>, for the gift of working
miracles, wherwith he was indewed) who as he was
one night hard at his work, had appearing vnto him, a vision
of a Diuel in the likenesse and attire of a very beautifull
wom&#257;, mouing &amp; intising him to the vice of lechery. But he
sodenly catching y&#868; iron which he wrought on, glowing hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
out of the fire, thrust it in y&#868; diuels face, and scorched his visage,
wherat he fretting &amp; crying out, in al hast fled away.</p>

<p>Likewise in his 7. booke and 23. chap. writing of the sedition
raised at <b><i>Antioche</i></b>, for the immoderat action and tribute
which <b>Theodosius</b> layd on the citie in the time of warres,
whereby the people being offended, ouerthrew the images
of the Emperour and his wife, dragging them in roapes
about the citie, and reporting all kinde of villany and dispite
against them, thus he saith. But in the night before,
assoone as the rebellion began, immediatly at the breake of
the day, it is certainly reported there was a straunge sight
s&eacute;ene, of a woman hauing a huge stature and most horrible
looke, running vp and downe the citie through the str&eacute;etes
aloft in the aire, whisking &amp; beating the aire with a whip,
rendring a fearefull sound. That as men are wont to prouoke
wilde beasts to anger, which serue for publike spectacles:
euen so it s&eacute;emed, some euil angell by the craft of
the diuell stirred vp that commotion amongst the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodorus.</div>

<p><b>Theodorus Lector</b>, in his first booke of Collectanies, out
of the Ecclesiasticall historie writeth, that as <b>Gennadius</b>
Patriarch of <b><i>Constantinople</i></b>, came downe to the high aultar
to make praiers and orizons, there appeared vnto him
a certaine vision or spirit in a most horrible shape and figure,
which so soone as he had sharply rebuked, straightwaies
he heard a voice crying out aloud, y&#877; so l&#333;g as he liued
he would giue place &amp; cease, but when he was once dead, he
would surely ransack and spoyle the Church. Which when
y&#868; good father heard, he ernestly praied for y&#868; preseruation of
the church, &amp; soone after departed this life. There are many
things to be read in <b>Gregori<sup>9</sup> Nicephor<sup>9</sup></b>, who setteth foorth
<span class="sidenote">Nicephorus.</span>
Ecclesiastical matters at large, &amp; <b>Abdias</b> in the liues of the
Apostles, concerning visions, dreames, miracles of saints,
and also appearings of spirites. For wise men iudge, they
were more diligent &amp; ready in describing such things, than
in other matters, which might haue bin to greater purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and much more profitable for the readers to vnderstand.</p>

<p>He that readeth ouer the Histories, which in times
past haue bene written, (and that especially by Monkes)
shall m&eacute;ete with an innumerable company of these sorts:
Yet by the way I must n&eacute;edes say this, that verie many
things haue bin written by them, which the Readers may
iustly suspect, and stand in great doubt of.</p>

<p><b>Ludouicus Viues</b>,
<b>Beatus Rhenanus</b>, and many other learned
men of our time, in describing other things, doo finde
great fault with the Chronicles written by Monkes, for
that they were gathered togither by vnlearned dolts without
any iudgement. But let euery man est&eacute;eme of them as
he list. For albeit there are diuers things in them very foolish
and ridiculous, yet it may be well thought that many
things were so in very d&eacute;ed, as they haue committed them
to writing.</p>

<p>A man shall m&eacute;ete with many places concerning visions
<span class="sidenote">Ambrose.</span>
and appearings of spirits, euen in the old fathers also.
S. <b>Ambrose</b> in his 90. Sermon, writeth of a noble Virgin
named <b>Agnes</b>, who was crowned with martirdome for the
professi&#333; of christian religion. And as her parents watched
one night by her graue, they saw about midnight, a goodly
company of Virgins cloathed in golden vayles, amongst
whome also was their daughter, arraied like vnto the rest:
who willing the other Virgins to staie awhile, turning her
selfe towards her parents, willed them in any case, not to
bewaile her as if she were dead, but rather to reioyce with
her, for that she had obteined of God eternal life. Which assoon
as she had spoken, she immediatly vanisht vanisht out of sight.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XIIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>That in the Bookes set foorth by Monkes, are many ridiculous
and vaine apparitions.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_wl.png" alt="W" width="150" height="155" />
E made mention a litle before, of Chronicles
written by Monkes. Now as
touching their legendes of Saintes (as
they terme their storehouses of examples,
and liues of auncient Fathers, in
the which are many apparitions of diuels
&amp; spirits,) verily there is no cause
at all why we should ascribe much vnto
them, for the most part of such stuffe as is set forth in them,
haue no shewe nor likelihood of truth: perchaunce their
minde was to bring men to great feare and Religion by
those their counterfeited and imagined histories. But concerning
these, this place now serueth not to intreate.</p>

<p>The like may be sayd, of many superstitious Popish
writers, who following these mens steppes, haue written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
many vpon other mens credit and reports, which least any
man thinke I write, being moued with enuie or hatred of
the persons, I will shewe you one onely historie or fable
amongst so many, that you may thereby haue as it were a
taste of that which I sayd euen now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Seuerine
Bishop of
Colin.</div>

<p><b>Petrus Damanus</b>, who first was a Monke after the order
of S. <b>Benedict</b>, and afterward Bishop of <b><i>Hostia</i></b>, a man
of great estimation among Papists, as well for the opinion
they had of his learning, as for the shewe of his vpright
liuing, telleth a storie of a certaine Monke of <b><i>Colein</i></b>,
who on a time passing ouer a Riuer on horsebacke, espied
Saint <b>Seuerinus</b> sometime Bishop of <b><i>Colein</i></b> on the Riuer,
who not long before was departed this life, and being buried
at that time, was much renowmed for doing sundrie
miracles. The Bishop catcheth holde on the Monkes
bridle, and would not let him passe any further: wherewith
the Monke was sore afraide, and diligently enquired
of him, why he being so notable a man, was there
withholden in that place. The Bishop then required him
to lende him his hand, that h&eacute;e might vnderstand by f&eacute;eling
how it was with him, which when he had done, and
that the Bishoppe had dipped the Monkes hande downe
into the water, sodeinly in one moment all the flesh of his
hand, by reason of the extreame heate, was scalded off, so
that the bones only remained al bare. Vnto whom then the
Monke, sith (quote h&eacute;e) thou art so famous a man in the
Church, how commeth it to passe that thou art so gr&eacute;euously
tormented? The Bishop aunswered: only sayd h&eacute;e for
this cause, for that I haue not sayd ouer my Canonicall
houres in due time distinctly as I should haue done: for
I was in the Emperours Court busied and occupied with
matters of his priuie Counsell, in the morning hudling
vp all my prayers at once, all the rest of the day I was
troubled with other businesse: and for that cause do I now
suffer this punishment of miserable heat. But let vs both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
togither call vnto Almightie God, that it may please him
to restore thy hand againe, which came presently to passe
assoone as they had thus saide. And then spake he to the
Monke saying: Go my sonne and desire the brethren of
our Church, as also al other of the Clergie there, to poure
out their praiers for m&eacute;e, to giue almes to the poore and
n&eacute;edie, and to perseuere incessantly in offring vp continuall
sacrifice for me, for so soone as these things shal be fulfilled,
I shal be deliuered out of these my torments, and shal be
ioyfully translated to the fellowship of those blessed Citizens
of heauen, which do earnestly desire my company.
Out of this historie, this argument or reason they make:
If that good and godly Bishop, who being ouercharged
with affaires of the Emperour leading to publike wealth,
could not dispatch his taske of prayers in due time, and
therefore is so miserably vexed and tormented, what punishment
may they looke for, which hauing no necessarie
businesse, say ouer the Canonicall houres very coldly, or
else leaue them cleane vnsayd, that they may the better
followe their owne lustes and vaine deuises? And h&eacute;ere
note by the way, they make no mention at all of omitting
those things which God hath expresly commanded vs.
But in case the Popish Bishoppes doo verily bel&eacute;eue this
story to be true, let them thinke with themselues, howe
they can be able to excuse themselues before the iudgement
seate of Almightie God, for that they are content to be created
Bishops of those Churches, whereof notwithstanding
they haue no care or regarde, but either wholly intangle
themselues with worldly matters, or if they do deale in
matters of the Church, their whole study is directed to this
end, to stop the sincere preaching of Gods word, and to tread
those vnderfoote whose mindes are occupied day and night,
to the aduancing and setting forth of Gods glory. Of this
stampe and sort, are most of those thinges wherewith the
Monkes inferred and stuffed their bookes.</p>

<p>S touching other notable writers, they
also make mention of spirites which do
oftentimes appear. <b>Alexander ab Alexandro</b>,
an excellent Lawier, born at <b><i>Naples</i></b>,
in his sec&#333;d booke <b><i>Gemalium dierum</i></b>,
and ninth chapter, writeth that a certain
familiar friend of his, of good credite, did
celebrate y&#868; funeral of one of his acquaintance,
and as he returned towards <b><i>Rome</i></b>, he entred into an
Inne fast by the way, because it was night, and there laide
himselfe downe to rest. As he laie there alone broad awake,
sodeinly the image of his friend lately deceased, came before
him maruellous pale and leane, euen as he was when
he sawe him last on his death bedde, whome when he beheld,
being almost besides himselfe with feare, he demaunded
of him who he was? But the ghost making no answer,
but slipping off his cloathes laide him downe in the same
bedde, and drew neare, as if he would haue embraced him.
The other gaue him place, and k&eacute;eping him off from him,
by chance touched his foote, which s&eacute;emed so extr&eacute;emly cold,
as no Ice in the world might be compared vnto it. Whereat
the other looking very lowringly vpon him, tooke vp his
clothes againe, and rose out of the bed, and was neuer afterwards
s&eacute;ene. He reporteth other histories in the same
place, which hapned in his time. He liued aboue foure score
yeares ago, or neare that time.</p>

<p><b>Baptista Fulgosus</b>, Duke of <b><i>Genua</i></b>, in his booke of worthy

the Court of <b>Mattheus</b>, surnamed the great Shiriffe of the

man farre exc&eacute;eding common stature, sitting on a horse in
complete armour: who when he had bin there s&eacute;ene of many,
by the space of an houre, in the end vanished away, to the
greate terrour of those that beheld him. About thr&eacute;e daies
after in like maner, two men on horsebacke of the same
stature, were s&eacute;ene in the same place, about thr&eacute;e houres
within night, fighting togither a long season, and in the
ende vanished away as the other didde before. Not long
after, Henry the seuenth Emperor, departed this life, to
the vtter vndoing of all the Shiriffes.</p>

<p>Immediately after this Historie, he putteth an other
more worthie memorie than the foremost. <b>Lodouicus</b> father

appeared vnto a Secretarie, whom <b>Ludouicus</b> had sente
to <b><i>Ferraria</i></b>, as he was on his iourney, riding on a horse
with a Hauke on his fist, as he was wonte when he liued,
and willed the Secretarie (albeit wonderfully afraid)
to bid his Sonne the nexte day to repaire vnto the same
place, for he had matter of greate importance to declare
vnto him. Which when <b>Lodouicus</b> heard, partly because
he could not bel&eacute;eue it, partly for that he doubted some body
laye in waight for him, he sent an other to answere in his
roome. With whome the same soule m&eacute;eting as it did before,
lamented very much that his Sonne was not come
thither, for if he had so doone, he saide, he would haue opened
many other things vnto him. But as then he willed
the messenger to tell him, that twentie two yeares, one
month and one day being passed, he should loose the rule and
gouernment whiche he nowe possessed. As soone as the
time foreshewed by the ghost was expired, albeit he were
very circumspect and careful, yet the same night, the souldiours
of <b>Philip</b> Duke of <b><i>Millen</i></b>, with whom he was in

<p><b>Phillip Melancthon</b>, writeth in his booke <b><i>De anima</i></b>, that
he himselfe hath s&eacute;ene some Spirits, and y&#877; he hath knowne
many men of good credit, which haue auouched not only to
haue s&eacute;ene ghostes themselues, but also that they haue
talked a great while with them. In his booke which he intituleth
<b><i>Examen Theologicum</i></b>, he rehearseth this historie.
Which was, that he had an aunt, who as she sat very heauily
by the fire, after her husband was dead, two men came
into her house, whereof the one being very like, said he was
her husband deceased, the other being verie tall, had the
shape of a <b>Franciscan</b> Friar. This that s&eacute;emed to be the husband,
came neare the chimney saluting his heauy wife, bidding
her not to be afraide, for (as he said) he came to commaund
her certaine things: then he bid the long Monke to
go aside a while into the stoue hard by. And there beginning
his talke, after many words, at the last be earnestly
bes&eacute;echeth, and most hartily desireth her, to hire a Priest to
say Masse for his soule, and so being readie to depart, he biddeth
her giue him her right hand: which thing (she being
sore afraide) abhorring to doo, after he had faithfully promised
she should haue no harme, she giueth her hand, which
albeit indeed it had no hurt, yet did it s&eacute;eme to be so scorched,
that euer after it remained blacke. This being done, he calleth
foorth the <b>Franciscan</b>, and hastily going forth togither,
they vanish away. <b>Ioannes Manlius</b>, in his collectanies of
Common places, writeth concerning other spirites which
he and other men also did s&eacute;e, the first tome in the Chapter
<b><i>De malis spiritibus &amp; ipsorum operibus</i></b>, and also in the Chapter

<h2>CHAP. XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>Daily experience teach vs, that spirits do appeare to men.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">TO all the premisses before handled, this also is to be added,
which no man can deny, but that many honest and
credible persons of both kindes, as well men as women, of
whome some are liuing, and some already departed, which
haue and do affirme, that they haue sometimes in the day,
and sometimes in the night s&eacute;ene and heard spirits. Some
man walketh alone in his house, and behold a spirit appeareth
in his sight, yea and sometimes the dogs also perceiue
them, and fal down at their masters f&eacute;et, and wil by no
means depart fro them, for they are sore afraid themselues
too. Some man goeth to bed, and laieth him downe to rest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and by and by there is some thing pinching him, or pulling
off the clothes: sometimes it sitteth on him, or lieth
downe in the bed with him: and many times it walketh
vp and downe in the Chamber. There haue bene many
times men s&eacute;ene, walking on foote, or riding on horseback,
being of a fierie shape, knowne vnto diuers men, &amp; such
as died not long before. And it hath come to passe likewise,
that some eyther slaine in the warres, or otherwise
deade naturally, haue called vnto their acquaintance b&eacute;eing
aliue, and haue bene knowne by their voice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirites requiring
helpe.</div>

<p>Many times in the night season, there haue b&eacute;ene certaine
spirits heard softly going, or spitting, or groning,
who being asked what they were, haue made aunswere
that they were the soules of this or that man, and that they
nowe endure extreame tormentes. If by chaunce any
man did aske of them, by what meanes they might be deliuered
out of those tortures, they haue aunswered, that
in case a certaine number of Masses were soong for them,
or Pilgrimages vowed to some Saintes, or some other
such like d&eacute;edes doone for their sake, that then surely they
shoulde be deliuered. Afterwardes appearing in greate
light and glorie, they haue said that they were deliuered,
and haue therefore rendred greate thankes to their good
benefactours, and haue in like manner promised, that
they will make intercession to God and our Ladye for
them. And hereby it may be well proued, that they were
not alwayes Priestes, or other bolde and wicked men,
which haue fayned themselues to be soules of men deceased,
as I haue before saide: in so much that euen in
those mennes chambers when they haue bene shut, there
haue appeared such things, when they haue with a candle
diligently searched before, whither any thing haue
lurked in some corner or no. Many vse at this day to search
and sifte euery corner of the house before they go to bed,
that they may sl&eacute;epe more soundly: &amp; yet neuerthelesse, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
heare some scriking out, and making a lam&#275;table noise, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It hath many times chanced, that those of the house haue
verily thought, that some body hath ouerthrowne the pots,
platters, tables and trenchers, and tumbled them downe
the staires: but after it waxed day, they haue founde all
things orderly set in their places againe.</p>

<p>It is reported, that some spirits haue throwne the doore
off from the hookes, and haue troubled and set all things in
the house out of order, neuer setting them in their due place
againe, and that they haue maruellously disquieted men
with rumbling and making a great noyse.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is heard a great noyse in Abbeis, and
in other solitarie places, as if it were Coopers hooping and
stopping vp wine vessels, or some other handicraftes men
occupied about their labour, when it is most certaine, that
all in the house are gone to bedde, and haue betaken themselues
to rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Builders hear
spirits in the
night.</div>

<p>When houses are in building, the neighbours many
times heare the Carpenters, Masons, and other Artificers
handling all things in such sort, as if they were busily labouring
in the day time. And this straunge wonder is ioyfully
receiued as a sure token of good lucke.</p>

<p>There be some which iudge it commeth to passe naturally,
that we suppose we heare these things in the night,
which we heard before in the day time. Which question I
leaue to be discussed of better learned than my selfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diuels are in
Mines.</div>

<p>Pioners or diggers for mettal, do affirme, that in many
mines, there appeare straunge shapes and spirites, who
are apparrelled like vnto other labourers in the pit. These
wander vp and down in caues and vnderminings, and s&eacute;em
to besturre themselues in all kinde of labour, as to dig after
the veine, to carry togither oare, to put it into baskets,
and to turne the winding wh&eacute;ele to drawe it vp, when in
very d&eacute;ed they do nothing lesse. They very sildome hurt
the labourers (as they say) except they prouoke them by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
laughing and rayling at them: for then they threw grauel
stones at them, or hurt them by some other means. These
are especially haunting in pittes, where mettall moste aboundeth.</p>

<p>A certain godly and learned man wrote once vnto me,
of a siluer mine at <b>Douosium</b>
in the <b><i>Alpes</i></b>, vpon the which
<b>Peter Buol</b> a noble man, the Schultish of the same place,
(whom they call <b>Landammanus</b>,) had bestowed great cost
a fewe yeres before, and had gathered therby good store of
riches. In the same myne was a spirite or Diuell of the
mountaine, who when the laborers filled the stuffe they
had digged into their vessels, he seemed, for the most parte,
euery Fridaye, to be very busie, pouring the mettals of his
owne accord out of one basket into an other. Wherewith
the Schultish was not offended: and when he would eyther
descende into the pit, or come vp againe, blessing himselfe
with the signe of the Crosse, he neuer receiued hurt.
It chaunced on a time that while the saide spirit was too
busie intermedling himselfe with euery thing, one of the
miners being offended therewith, began to raile at him
very bitterly, and with terrible cursing words, bid him
get him thence in the diuels name. But the spirit caught
him by the pate, and so writhed his necke about, that his
face stoode behinde his backe, yet notwithstanding he was
not slaine, but liued a long time after, well knowne vnto
diuers of his familiar friends, which yet liue at this day,
howbeit he died within a fewe yeares after.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agricola.</div>

<p><b>Georgius Agricola</b>, whose learned workes which he
wrote of mettalles, be yet extant in the end of his booke of
creatures liuing vnder the earth, he maketh two kindes of
Diuels haunting in certayne Mynes abroade. For h&eacute;e
saith, there are some cruell and terrible to behold: which
for the moste parte, doo very much annoy and hurt the labourers
digging for mettall.</p>

<p>Suche a one was h&eacute;e which was called <b>Annebergius</b>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
who only with his breath, destroyed aboue 12. labourers at
once, in the Caue called <b>Corona Rosacea</b>. The wind wherwith
he slewe them, he let fl&eacute;e out of his mouth: for he appeared
in the similitude and likenesse of an horse.</p>

<p>Such an other was <b>Snebergius</b>, who wearing a blacke
roll about his necke, tooke vp a labourer aloft from the
ground, and set him in the brinke of a certaine exceeding
d&eacute;epe place, where had sometime bene great store of siluer,
not without gr&eacute;euous brusing of his bodie.</p>

<p>And againe he saith, there be some very milde and gentle,
whom some of the <b>Germanes</b> call <b>Cobali</b>,
as the <b>Grecians</b>
do, because they be as it were apes and counterfeiters
of men: for they leaping and skipping for ioy do laugh, and
s&eacute;eme as though they did many things, when in very d&eacute;ed
they do nothing. And som other call them elues, or dwarfes
of the Mountaines, thereby noting their small stature,
wherein they commonly appeare. They s&eacute;eme to be hoare,
wearing apparell like the mettall Finers, that is, in a peticoate
laced, and an aperne of leather about their loynes.
These hurt not the labourers, except they misuse them, but
do imitate them in all their doings. And he saith, they are
not much vnlike vnto those whom the <b>Germanes</b>
call <b>Guteli</b>,
because they s&eacute;eme to beare good affection towards men,
for they k&eacute;ep horses, and do other necessary businesse. They
are also like vnto them whom they call <b>Trulli</b>, who taking
on them the feined shapes of men and women, do serue as it
is sayd, like seruants, both amongst other nations, and specially
amongst the <b>Suetians</b>.</p>

<p>Touching these spirits haunting Mines of mettal, there
is somewhat to be read in <b>Olaus Magnus de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</b>,
the sixt booke and tenth Chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VVhich are
people that
eate and deuoure
men.</div>

<p>They which saile on the great Ocean sea, make report,
that in certaine places, where the <b>Anthropophagi</b> do inhabit,
are many spirits, which doo the people there very much
harme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Here many straunge things might be brought concerning
visions appearing vnto men in their sl&eacute;epe: and also
of them, which being in a traunce, haue lyen a whole day
and more without mouing, lyke vnto dead men: and after
being restored to themselues againe, haue told many miraculous
things which they haue s&eacute;ene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cicero.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Augustine.</div>

<p><b>Cicero</b> writeth of maruellous things in his booke of diuination,
or soothsaying. And so do many other men also.
<b>Augustine</b> himselfe reciteth in many places of his bookes,
that some after they were dead, haue warned many their
friends of diuers matters, and haue disclosed vnto them secrete
things, which were to come, and haue shewed sicke
folkes good remedies for their diseases, and haue done many
such like things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marsilius.</div>

<p><b>Auenzoar Albumato</b>, a Phisitian of <b><i>Arabia</i></b>, writeth,
that he receiued an excellent medicine for his sore eyes, of
a Phisitian lately deceased, appearing vnto him in his sl&eacute;ep:
as <b>Marcilius Ficinus</b> doth testifie, writing of the immortalitie
of the soule. <b>Lib. 16. cap. 5.</b></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mat.1.&amp; 2.</i></div>

<p>The holy Scriptures also teach vs, that God hath reuealed
many things vnto men by dreames. <b>S. Mathew</b> in
his first and second chapter writeth, that the Angell of God
appeared many times vnto <b>Ioseph</b>, our Sauiour Christes
foster father in a dreame, and commaunded him to beware
of those which laie in wayt to destroy Christ Iesus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Acts.</i></div>

<p>We reade in the tenth Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
that S. <b>Peter</b> fell into a traunce, sawe the heauens
open, and sawe a vessell, as it were a great sh&eacute;ete, descend
downe vnto him from heauen, knit togither at the foure
corners, wherein were all maner of foure footed beastes of
the earth, and wilde beasts, and cr&eacute;eping things, and foules
of the heauen. And there came a voyce vnto him: Rise <b>Peter</b>,
kill and eate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Acts 16.</i></div>

<p>And in the 16. Chapter, as S. <b>Paul</b> was yet in <b><i>Asia</i></b>, comming
downe towardes <b><i>Troada</i></b>, this vision appeared vnto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
him: There stoode a man of <b><i>Macedonia</i></b> and prayed him,
saying: Come into <b><i>Macedonia</i></b> and helpe vs. Hereby <b>Paule</b>
gathered, it was the will of God, that he should passe the
sea, and should preach the Gospell in <b><i>Macedonia</i></b>.</p>

<p>But I purpose not to write of spirites and visions appearing

<p class="center"><b>That there happen straunge wonders and prognostications,<br />
and that sodein noyses and cracks and such like, are heard<br />
before the death of men, before battaile, and before some<br />
notable alterations and chaunges.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_il.png" alt="I" width="150" height="156" />
T hapneth many times, that wh&#275; men
lie sicke of some deadly disease, there is
some thing heard going in the chamber,
like as the sicke men were wont, when
they were in good health: yea &amp; the sicke
parties themselues, do many times hear
the same, and by and by gesse what will
come to passe. Oftentimes a litle before
they y&eacute;eld vp y&#868; ghost, and sometime a litle after their death,
or a good while after, either their own shapes, or som other
shadowes of men, are apparantly s&eacute;en. And diuers times it
commeth to passe, that when some of our acquaintaunce or
friends lie a dying, albeit they are many miles off, yet there
are some great stirrings or noises heard. Sometimes we
think y&#868; house wil fal on our heads, or y&#877; some massy &amp; waightie
thing falleth down throughout all y&#868; house, rendring and
making a disordered noise: and shortly within fewe moneths
after, we vnderstand that those things happened, the
very same house y&#877; our friends departed in. There be some
men, of whose stock none doth die, but that they obserue and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
marke some signes and tokens going before: as that they
heare the doores and windowes open and shut, that some
things runneth vp the staires, or walketh vp and downe the
house, or doth some one or other such like thing.</p>

<p>But here I cannot passe this in silence: that there are
many superstitious m&#275;, which vainly persuade themselues
that this cousin, and this or that friend of theirs will shortly
die. For in the end, the falling out of the matter it selfe,
sheweth it was a vaine and foolish persuasion, that they vnderstood
such things by any signes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardanus.</div>

<p><b>Cardanus</b> in his booke <b><i>De veritate rerum</i></b>, writeth, that
there was a certaine noble Familie at <b><i>Parma</i></b> in <b><i>Italy</i></b>, out
of the which so often as any one died, there was s&eacute;ene an
olde woman in the chimney corner. On a certaine time
sh&eacute;e appeared, when a mayden of the same family laie very
sick, and therfore they cleane dispaired of her life: but soone
after she recouered again, and in the meane while, an other,
which was then in good health, sodainly died.</p>

<p>There was a certaine parish priest, a very honest and
godly man, whome I knew well, who in the plague time,
could tell before hand, when any of his parish should die.
For in the night time he heard a noyse ouer his bed, lyke
as if one had throwne downe a sacke full of corne from his
shoulders: which when he heard, he would say: Now an
other biddeth me farewell. After it was day, he vsed to inquire
who died that night, or who was tak&#275; with y&#868; plague,
to the ende he might comfort and strengthen them, according
to the dutie of a good pastor.</p>

<p>It hath bin often obserued in Guilde Halles where Aldermen
sit, that when one of those Aldermen was at the
point of death, there was heard some ratling about his
seate, or some other certaine signe of death. The same thing
happeneth beside pewes and stalles in Churches, or in other
places where men are often conuersaunt, or accustomed
to exercise their handie labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>In Abbies, the Monkes seruants or any other falling
sicke, many haue heard in the night, preparation of chestes
for them, in such sort as the Coffin-makers did afterwards
prepare in d&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>In some country villages, when one is at deaths doore,
many times there are some heard in the Euening, or in
the night, digging a graue in the Churchyard, and the same
the next day is so founde digged, as these men did heare before.</p>

<p>There haue bin s&eacute;ene some in the night when the Moone
shined, going solemnely with the corpes, according to the
custome of the people, or standing before the doores, as if
some bodie were to bee carried to the Church to burying.
Many suppose, they s&eacute;e their owne image, or as they say,
their owne soule, and of them diuers are verily perswaded,
that except they die shortly after they haue s&eacute;en themselues,
they shall liue a very great time after. But these things
are superstitious. Let euery man so prepare himselfe, as it
he should die to morrow, least by being too secure, he purchase
himselfe harme.</p>

<p>There happen other straunge things also. For when
some lye in the prison in chaines, readie to suffer punishment
for their offences, many times in the night season,
there is heard a great noyse and rumbling, as if some bodie
were breaking into y&#868; gaile to deliuer the prisoners. When
men come to vnderstand the matter, they can neither hear,
nor s&eacute;e any bodie, and the prisoners likewise say they heard
no maner thing.</p>

<p>Some executioners or hangmen do report, that for the
most part, they know before hand whether any man shall
shortly bee deliuered into their handes to suffer: for their
swordes will moue of their owne accord. And there are
other that say, they can tell before, after what sort the prisoners
shall suffer.</p>

<p>Many wonderfull and straunge things happen about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
those which wilfully cast away themselues. Somtime their
corpses must be carried a great way off, before they being
thrust in a sack can be throwne into the sea: and being laid
in a waggon or cart, the horse could scant draw them downe
the hill, but vp the hill they n&eacute;ed not labour at all, for the
cart would runne very fast of his owne accord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virgil.</div>

<div class="sidenote">De animorum immortalitate
li.16.cap.5.</div>

<p>Some men being slaine by th&eacute;eues, when the th&eacute;eues
come to the dead bodie, by and by there gusheth out freshe
blood, or else there is declaration by other tokens, that the

th&eacute;efe is there present. <b>Plato</b> writeth in the first booke of
his lawes, that the soules of such as haue bene slaine, do oftentimes
cruelly molest &amp; trouble the soules of those which
slew them. For which cause <b>Marsilius Fiscinus</b> doth thinke
it chaunceth, that the wound of a man being slaine, while
the carkasse lieth on the ground, doth send out blood against
him, which wounded him, if he stand neare looking on his
wound. Which thing both <b>Lucretius</b> affirmeth to come to
passe, and also Iustices haue diligently obserued. <b>Dido</b> in
<b>Virgil</b> thus threatneth <b>Aeneas</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>And when the cold of death is come, and body voyd remaines,<br />
Each where my haunting spirit shall pursue thee to thy paines.</i><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The like place is in <b>Horace</b> &amp; in other Poets. As a th&eacute;efe
sitteth at the Table, a cuppe being ouerthrowne, the wine
pearceth through the whole and sound wood of the Table,
to all mens admiration.</p>

<p>Touching these and other such maruellous things, there
might be many histories and testimonies alleaged. But
whosoeuer readeth this booke, may call to their remembrance,
that they haue s&eacute;en these and such like things themselues,
or that they haue heard them of their friendes and
acquaintance, and of such as deserue sufficient credit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suetonius.</div>

<p>Before the alterations and chaunges of kingdomes and
in the time of warres, seditions, and other dangerous seasons,
ther most comm&#333;ly happen very strange things in the
aire, in y&#868; earth, and amongst liuing creatures clean c&#333;trary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to the vsuall course of nature. Which things men cal, wonders,
signes, monsters, and forewarnings of matters to
come. There are s&eacute;ene in the aire, swords, speares, &amp; suche
like, innumerable: there are heard and s&eacute;ene in the aire, or
vppon the earth, whole armies of men encountring togither,
and when one part is forced to flye, there is heard horrible
cries, and great clattering of armour. Gunnes, launces
and holberdes, with other kindes of weapons and artillerie,
do often times moue of their owne accord as they
lye in the armories. When as souldiers marche towards
their enimies, and their ensignes will not displaie abroade
but fold about the stander-bearers heads: if the souldiours
be therewith amazed, they surely perswade themselues
there is some great slaughter towardes. It is saide also,
that horses will be very sad and heauie, and will not lette
their masters sit on their backes, before they go to the battaile
wherin they shall haue the ouerthrow: but when they
are coragious and lustilie neighing, it is a sure token of victorie.
<b>Suetonius</b> writeth, that the company of horses which
<b>Iulius Cæsar</b> let run at libertie, neuer to be put to labour
againe, did w&eacute;epe aboundantly when <b>Cæsar</b> was slaine.</p>

<p>When <b>Miltiades</b> addressed his people against the <b><i>Persians</i></b>,
there were heard tirrible noyses before the battaile,
and certaine spirits were s&eacute;ene, which the <b>Athenians</b> afterwards
affirmed to be the shaddowe of <b>Pan</b>, who cast suche
a feare on the <b><i>Persians</i></b>, that they turned their backs and
fled. Thereof <b>Terrores Panici</b> tooke their name, being spoken
of sodayn feares vnlooked for, and terrours, suche as
<b>Lymphatici metus</b> are, which driue men out of their wits
being taken therewith.</p>

himselfe slaine. Concerning which matter, <b>Titus Liuius</b>
writeth at large. In the beginning of the warres waged

reade in the history of the siege of the noble citie of <b><i>Magdeburge</i></b>
in <b><i>Saxonie</i></b>, that the enimie which laide siege to the

<p class="center"><b>It is proued by testimonies of holy scripture, that spirites<br />
are sometime seene and heard, and that other straunge<br />
matters do often chaunce.</b></p>

<div class="sidenote">Luke 14.</div>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_yl.png" alt="Y" width="150" height="154" />

Et perchaunce it will be obiected vnto
vs, that we bring no testimony out of
holy scripture, touching this matter:
especially to proue, that Spirits do oftentimes
appeare vnto men. I answer,
that truth it is, There are fewe things
hereof in the scriptures, and yet notwithstanding
somewhat is to be redde
in them. It is read in S. <b>Matthew</b> his fourt&eacute;enth Chapter,
of Christs Disciples, that when in the night season, by reason
of a contrary wind, they were in great danger of drowning
in the lake of <b>Genazareth</b>, and that in the dawning of
the day, the Lord walked on the water, they being afraide,
cried out, supposing they sawe a Spirit. Hereof we gather,
that they knew well inough, that Spirits appeared vnto
men vpon sea and land.</p>

<p>Likewise when the Lord being risen from death, appeared
vnto his Disciples, meaning to assure them of his
resurrection, they thought at the first, that they sawe a Spirit.
In the which place, Christ denieth not but there are
Spirits and straunge sightes, and that they are sometimes
s&eacute;ene, but he rather confirmeth the same by putting a difference
betw&eacute;ene himselfe, and Spirits of vaine apparitions.
But as touching these two testimonies, we wil speak more
in another place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">2.Samuel.</div>

<p>It is a notable historie which we read in the seconde
Booke of <b>Samuel</b> concerning <b>Saule</b>, who, at what time the
Philistians warred vppon him, and that he was in verie
great daunger of them, he came to a woman, who was a
witch, and desired her to raise <b>Samuel</b> from death, that he
might know his counsell touching the successe of the wars.
She raised him vp one, whom <b>Saule</b> tooke to be <b>Samuel</b> ind&eacute;ede,
who also tolde him what euente shoulde come of the
warres. But whether h&eacute;e were a true <b>Samuel</b> or a counterfait,
w&eacute;e will dispute the matter more at large in his
conuenient place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2.Samuel.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1.Paral.14.</div>

<p>As concerning other maruellous things, there is somewhat
to be read in the Scriptures: In the seconde of <b>Samuel</b>
&amp; the fift chap. Also in the first of <b>Paralipomenon</b>,
and the .xiiii. chap. we reade, that the Philistines went vp
the seconde time into Iurie, to make warres on <b>Dauid</b>:
H&eacute;e went vnto the Lord, and shewed him the matter, who
commaunded him, that he shoulde embushe himselfe behinde
the wood with his armie, and when he heard a rustling
or noise in the toppes of the tr&eacute;es, he should immediatly
sette vppon them. This sounde they say was a strange
and supernaturall sound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2.Reg.6.7.</div>

<p>It is written in the second booke of the Kings the .vi. and
vii. chapters, that God deliuered the citie of <b><i>Samaria</i></b> from
great famine, when it was fiercely besieged by <b>Benhadad</b>
king of the <b><i>Assirians</i></b>, for in the night season their enemies
did heare the noise of the chariots, the neighing of horsses,
and shr&eacute;eching of a huge armie, as it were in their owne
pauillions and tentes, supposing therefore, that the kyng
of Israel had gathered togither his footemen and horssemen,
and had nowe sette vppon them, they soughte to saue
themselues by flighte, leauing theyr victuall and other
prouision behinde them in their tentes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1.Samu.7.</div>

<p>In the first of <b>Samuel</b> and the seuenth chapter, God
caused a wonderfull greate noyse to sounde ouer the Philistians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and so destroyed them. I meane they were so affrighted
with a kinde of straunge feare, that it was an easie
matter to vanquish them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Daniel</i> 5.</div>

<p>In the fifth Chapter of <b>Daniel</b> ye may reade, that king
<b>Balthasar</b> in his roysting banquet, espied right against the
candle, a hand writing vpon the wall what his end should
be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. <i>Macha.</i> 3.</div>

<p>It is redde in the third Chapter of the seconde of the
<b>Machabees</b>, that there appeared a horsse vnto <b>Heliodorus</b>,
seruant vnto <b>Seleucus</b> king of <b><i>Asia</i></b>, as he was about to destroy
the temple of <b><i>Hierusalem</i></b>: and vpon the horsse s&eacute;emed
to sit a terrible man, which made towards him to ouerrun
him. On eache side of him were two yoong men of excellent
beautie, which with whippes scourged <b>Heliodorus</b>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. <i>Mach.</i> 10.</div>

<p>The second of the <b>Machabees</b> and tenth chapter, <b>Iudas
Machabeus</b> encountred with his enemies, and when the
battaile was hotte, there appeared vnto the enemy out of
heauen, fiue men sitting on horses, rayned with notable bridles
of gold, who ledde the Iewes hoste, and two of them
defended <b>Machabeus</b> from all his enemies.
<span class="sidenote">2. <i>Mach.</i> 11.</span>
And vnto <b>Machabeus</b>
appeared a horsman in a shining garment, his armour
all of gold, and shaking his speare. Whereby it was
signified, that he should obtaine a notable and famous victorie.
2. <b>Macha.</b> 11.</p>

<p>I alleadge not these examples, for that I adiudge the
bookes of <b>Machabees</b>, of as good authoritie as the Canonicall
bookes of the new and old Testament: but only for that
they are ioyned togither with them, and may be read of euery
one: and they were alwaies read of the auncient people.
For albeit they neuer went about to approue any
doctrine by them, yet were they of great authoritie am&#333;gst
them.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>To whome, when, where, and after what sort, Spirites do<br />
appeare, and what they do worke.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_bl.png" alt="B" width="150" height="155" />
Y all these examples we may plainly
perceiue, that many strange things are
obiected to mens senses, and that sometimes
Spirits are s&eacute;ene and heard, not
only (as some haue thought, as <b>Plutark</b>
witnesseth in the life of <b>Dion</b>) of children,
women, sicke folkes, dottards, and
otherwise very plain and simple creatures, but also to men
of good courage, and such as haue bin perfectly in their wits.
Yet it may not be denied but that there appeare many more
vnto some, than vnto other some, as vnto trauellers, watch-men,
hunters, carters, and marriners, who leade all their
life not only in the day time, but also in night, in iourneying,
in the water, woods, hills and vallies. You shall m&eacute;ete
with some one who neuer sawe nor heard any of this geare
in all his life time, and contrariwise, there be other some
which haue s&eacute;ene and heard very many such like things.</p>

<p>So there are some which very sildom chance vpon Serpents,
and againe, many there are which oftentimes m&eacute;ete
with them in their iourney. The common people say, that
those whose natiuities chance vpon the Angaries (for so they
terme the foure seasons of the yeare) do s&eacute;e more store of spirits,
than those which are borne at other times, but these
are m&eacute;ere trifles. Those which are stedfast in true faith, s&eacute;e
or heare such things more sildome than superstitious people,
as in all other things. He that is superstitious, vseth
some blessing (as they call it) to heale his Horsses disease,
and it taketh good effect: he enchaunteth a Serpent, and
it cannot once mooue out of the place. He applieth a blessing
to staunche bl&eacute;edyng, and it stoppeth presently:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
He taketh a hollie rod, or twisted wand inchanted, &amp; it will
moue where a mettle mine is: but he that is of a sounde
fayth and doth despise these things, (for he knoweth well
they are contrary to the word of God, and also to the Popes
decr&eacute;es) albeit perchaunce he practise such things, yet notwithstanding
he can bring nothing to passe. And so also it
chaunceth that he seeth spirites and vaine visions, a great
deale more seldome than superstitious men do, for h&eacute;e
knoweth well what h&eacute;e ought to d&eacute;eme and iudge of them.
There are some kinde of men, who thinke it a gay thing,
if many such straunge sights appeare vnto them.</p>

<p>There were farre many more of these kindes of apparitions
and myracles s&eacute;ene amongest vs, at such times
as we were giuen vnto blindnesse and superstition, than
since that the Gospell was purely preached amongest vs:
the cause whereof I will shewe hereafter.</p>

<p>And moreouer it commeth oftentimes to passe, that some
one man doth heare or s&eacute;e some thing most plainly, when
an other which standeth by him, or walketh with him, neyther
seeth, nor heareth any such matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some men see
things which
other men see
not.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Actes</i>.9.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Actes</i>.22.</div>

<p>We reade in the historie of <b>Heliseus</b>, that he sawe chariottes
of fire, and many horsmen vpon the toppe of the
Mountaine: and yet his seruaunt sawe nothing vntill the
Prophet prayed vnto the Lord, that he would vouchsafe
for his confirmation and consolation, to open his eyes
that he might also behold this notable miracle. So likewise
we reade in the 9. chapter of the Actes of the Apostles,
that Christ ouerthrew <b>Paule</b> before <b><i>Damascus</i></b>, and
that he spake vnto him, and his companions also hearde
the voice. Afterwardes in the 22. chapter, <b>Paule</b> himselfe
shewing vnto the people in the presence of <b>Lycias</b>, in the
Castle at <b><i>Hierusalem</i></b>, what had happened vnto them, saith
that they heard not the voice of him that talked with him:
which two places are not repugnant, for the meaning is,
that they heard a voyce or sounde ind&eacute;ede, but they vnderstood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
not what the Lord had sayd vnto him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Socrates familiar.</div>

<p><b>Plato</b> writeth in his dialogue called <b><i>Theages</i></b>, that <b>Socrates</b>
had a familiar spirit, who was woonte to put him in
mynd to cease from labouring, when that which he attempted
should haue no happie successe. This spirit he himselfe
sawe not, and other men hearde not. They say that sometimes
Children doe s&eacute;e certaine things, which other men see
not, and by a certaine peculiar operation of nature, some
men behold that which others in no wise can perceiue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At what time
spirits appeare.</div>

<p>As touching the time when spirits appeare, we reade
in histories that it shall be after a thousand yeares which
God hath appoynted, in the which time Sainte Iohn prophesied
<span class="sidenote">Apocalips.</span>
in the Apocalips, that Sathan shoulde be lette loose,
that is to saye, errours and superstition, and al kinde of misch&eacute;efe
shuld abound, and many spirits appear euery where:
for men gaue them more credite, than the Scriptures. If a
spirit appeared, or was heard to say in case these or those
things be decreed, to wit, vowed Pilgrimage, and erecting
Chappelles, and that this shall be an acceptable kinde of
worship vnto God, the Bishoppes and paryshe Priestes
weighed not whether those things were agr&eacute;eable to the
word of God or no, &amp;c. Spirits appeared in old time, and do
appeare still in these dayes both day and night, but especially
in the night, and before midnighte in our first sl&eacute;epe.
Moreouer, on the frydayes, satterdayes, and fasting dayes,
to confirme superstition. Neither may we maruell, that
they are heard more in the night, than in the day time. For
he who is the author of these things, is called in the holye
Scriptures the Prince of darkenesse, and therefore he shunneth
the light of Gods word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In what place
spirits are seen.</div>

<p>And albeit these are heard or s&eacute;ene in al places, yet are
they most especially conuersant in the fieldes where battels
haue bene fought, or in places where slaughters haue
bene made: in places of execution; in woods into the which
they have coniured deuils being cast out of men: in Churches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Monasteries, and about Sepulchers, in the bounds of
countries, and buts of lands: in prisons, houses and towers,
and sometime also in the ruines and rubbish of Castles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Esay</i> 13.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Monsters of

<div class="sidenote"><i>Esay</i>.34.</div>

<p>God threatneth the Babilonians in the 13. chap. of <b>Esay</b>,
that Spirits and Satyres shal daunce where their magnificent
houses and Pallaces were, where they were wont to
lead their daunces. And in his 34. chapter, where he threatneth
destruction vnto all nations and enemies of God, he
saith: In the ruinous and tottering Pallaces, Castles, and
houses, horrible spirites shall appeare with terrible cries,
and the Satyro shall call vnto her mate, yea and the night
hags shall take their rest there. For by the sufferaunce of
God, wicked diuels worke straunge things in those places
where men haue exercised pride and crueltie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">After what
sort spirites
appeare.</div>

<p>The maner of appearing of spirits, is diuers and manifold,
as it appeareth by those things which I haue alleaged
before. For they shewe themselues in sundry sorts: sometimes
in the shape of a man whom we know, who is yet aliue,
or lately departed: and otherwhile in the likenesse of
one whom we know not.</p>

<p>I heard of a graue and wise man, which was a Magistrate
in the Territorie of <b><i>Tigurie</i></b>, who affirmed, that as
he and his seruant went through the pastures, in the sommer
very early, he espied one whome he knew very well,
wickedly defiling himselfe with a Mare, wherewith being
amazed, he returned back againe, and knocked at his house,
whome he supposed he had s&eacute;en, and ther vnderstood for a certaintie,
that he went not on foote out of his chamber y&#877; morning.
And in case he had not diligently searched out y&#868; matter,
the good &amp; honest man had surely bin cast in prison, and
put on the rack. I reherse this history for this end, that Iudges
should be very circumspect in these cases, for y&#868; diuell by
these means doth oftentimes circumuent y&#868; innocent. <b>Chunegunda</b>
wife vnto <b>Henry</b> the 2. Emperour of y&#877; name, was
greatly suspected of adultery, and thereuppon many false

rumors scattered, that she was too familiar with a certaine
yoong man in the Court, for the Diuell in the likenesse of
the same yoong man, was oftentimes s&eacute;ene come out of the
Empresse Chamber. But she afterwards declared her innocencie
by treading vppon hotte glowing ploughshares,
(as the custome was then) without any hurting her f&eacute;ete,
as witnesseth <b>Albertus Cranzius</b>, in his fourth booke, and
first Chapter of his <b><i>Metropolis</i></b>.</p>

<p>We reade that many spirites haue appeared vnto certaine
Hermites and Monkes in the shape of a woman, alluring
and intising them to filthie lust. They appeare also
in the fourme of brute beastes, sometime foure footed,
as of a Dogge, a Swine, a Horsse, a Goate, a Catte, or a
Hare: and sometimes of foules, and cr&eacute;eping wormes, as
of a Crow, a night Owle, a schritch Owle, a Snake, or
Dragon, whereof the Gentiles had great plentie in their
Temples and houses, and nourished them, as we may
reade euery where in the Poets. Spirits haue sometimes
appeared in a pleasaunt fourme, and sometimes in a horrible
shape. At one time some hath bene s&eacute;ene ryding on
horsebacke, or going on foote, or crawling vppon all foure.
At an other time hath appeared a man all burning in fire,
or beraide with blood: and somewhile, his bowelles haue
s&eacute;emed to traile out, his belly being as it were ripped vp.
Sometimes a shadow hath onely appeared: sometimes a
hand, sometimes an instrument, as a staffe, a sworde, or
some such lyke thing which the spirite helde in his hande.
Sometimes he appeared in maner of a bundle of hey, burning
on fire: another while onely a hoarse kinde of voyce
was heard. Sometimes a spirit hath bene heard walking
in the inner parte of the house, turning the leaues of a
Booke, or telling money, or playing at dice, or bounsing
against the wall. And sometimes there is heard a terrible
noyse or clappe, as if a peale of Gunnes were discharged
hard at hand. And spirits sometimes, taking a man by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
arme or by the haire of the head, haue walked with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olaus.</div>

<p><b>Olaus Magnus</b> in his third booke and eleuenth Chapter

certaine monsters or spirites, which taking on them some
<span class="sidenote">Daunces of Spirits.</span>
shape or figure, vse (chiefly in the night season) to daunce,
after the sounde of all maner of instruments of musicke:

<p>And here we may in no wise ouerpasse in silence, that
notable historie which <b>Plutarch</b> in his booke <b><i>De fectu oraculorum</i></b>,
(translated by that learned man <b>Adrianus Turnebus</b>)
reciteth in these words. Touching the death of diuels,
I haue heard a certaine historie of one who was neither
foolish, nor accustomed to lye. For it was <b>Epitherces</b>,
my countreyman, a professour of Grammer, father vnto
<b>Æmilianus</b> the Rhethoritian, of whome some of you also
haue heard the same: He told me, that when he once tooke
ship, meaning to go into <b><i>Italie</i></b>, because he carried with him
not only great store of marchandise, but also very many
passengers, in the euening when they were about the Islands
<b>Echinadæ</b>, the wind quite ceased, and that the shippe
driuing in the Sea, being brought at the last vnto <b><i>Paxe</i></b>,
many then waking, and many also quaffing after they had
supped, sodeinly there was heard a voyce of one which called
<b>Thamus</b>, in such sort that euery man maruelled. This
<b>Thamus</b> was a Pilotte borne in <b><i>Egipt</i></b>, vnknowne vnto
many which were in the ship. Wherefore being twice called,
he held his peace, and the third time answered: then the
other with a louder voyce commaunded him, that when
he came vnto <b>Palodes</b>, h&eacute;e should tell them that the great
God <b>Pan</b> was departed. When this was heard, euery man
was amazed with feare, as <b>Epitherces</b> affirmed vnto vs:
And being in consultation whether they should do as was
commaunded or not, <b>Thamus</b> thus iudged of the matter:
that if the winde did blowe, they must passe by with silence,
but if it were calme without winde, he must vtter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that which we had heard. When therefore they were come
to <b><i>Palodes</i></b>, and no wind stirred, nor waue moued, <b>Thamus</b>
looking out of the sterne towards the lande, cryed out as he
had heard, that the great God <b>Pan</b> was deceased: H&eacute;e had
scant ended those words, when immediatly there followed
a great groning, not of one man, but of many, being admixt
as it were with great admiration. And because many were
present in the ship, (they said) the same hereof was sp&eacute;edely
spred abroad at <b><i>Rome</i></b>, and <b>Thamus</b> sent by <b>Tiberius</b> y&#868; Emperour,
who gaue so much credit vnto the matter, that he
diligently enquired, and asked who that <b>Pan</b> was. The
learned men whome he had in great number about him,
supposed that <b>Pan</b> was he, who was the sonne of <b>Mercurie</b>
and <b>Penelope</b>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">De preparatione
Euang.
li.5.chap.9.</div>

<p>These and such like things, (<b>Eusebius</b> who also reciteth
this historie) affirmeth to haue chaunced in that time of
<b>Tiberius</b>, in the which Christ being conuersant amongst
men, expelled all maner of diuels from the societie of them.
Other most godly professours of our Religion, affirme,
<span class="sidenote">Paulus Marsus.</span>
(as namely <b>Paulus Marsus</b>, in his Annotations vppon the
first of <b>Ouids Fasti</b>) that this voyce was heard out of <b><i>Paxe</i></b>,
the very same night ensuing the day wherein our Lorde
suffered, in the 19. yeare of <b>Tiberius</b>, which was the same
yeare that Christ was crucified in: by the whiche voyce
being vttered in a wildernesse of solitary rockes, it was declared
that our Lord and God had suffered for vs. For the
word <b>Pan</b> in Greeke, signifieth all: and then the Lord of al
the world was crucified.</p>

<p>He addeth moreouer, that <b>Theodosius</b> doth say, that
the <b><i>Archadians</i></b> doo worship this God, calling him
<span class="gktext">&tau;&#8056;&nu; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&#8020;&lambda;&eta;&sigmaf; &kappa;&#8059;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
meaning thereby to signifie a Lorde and Ruler,
not of words, but of all manner of materiall substances:
whose power is suche, that it is able to create the essence
and substaunce of all bodies, whether that they be heauenly,
or earthly. And albeit he referre this vnto the Sunne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
yet if a man marke diligently, his mysteries haue a higher
meaning, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hunting of
Diuels.</div>

<p>Hereunto belongeth those thinges which are reported
touching the chasing or hunting of diuels, and also of the
daunces of dead men, which are of sundry sortes. I haue
heard of some which haue auouched, that they haue s&eacute;ene
them.</p>

<p>No man is able to rehearse all the shapes wherein spirits
haue appeared, for the diuell, who for the most part is
the worker of these things, can (as the Poets faine of <b>Proteus</b>)
chaunge himselfe into all shapes and fashions.</p>

<p>These walking spirites sometimes stoppe the way before
men as they trauell, and leade them out of their way,
and put them in suche great feare, that sometimes they
become grayheaded in one night. I remember I haue
heard the like historie of my olde friende <b>Iohn Willing</b>,
a godly and learned man, of one in the Countie of <b><i>Hannow</i></b>,
who not many yeares ago, m&eacute;eting with a walkyng
spirite in the night season, was so much altered, that at
his returning home, his owne Daughters knewe him
not.</p>

<p>Spirites oftentimes awake men out of their sl&eacute;epe, and
cause many to forsake their owne houses, so that they cannot
hire them out to any other. Sometimes they ouerthrow
somewhat, or strike men, or cast stones at them, and
hurt them either in their bodies or in their goods: yea and
sometime God doth suffer them to bereaue men of their
liues. It often chaunceth that those mens faces and heads
do swel, which haue s&eacute;ene or heard spirits, or haue bene blasted
with them: and some are taken mad, as we s&eacute;e by experience.
I remember well it hath happened, that some supposing
they haue s&eacute;ene armed men, who were ready to take
them, haue therefore assaied to slaie themselues: which
thing may be by craft of the diuel. Spirites do also trouble
cattell in the night time, in the pastures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus much concerning the first part of this worke,
wherein (I trust) I haue proued, and made it euident, that
albeit there be many which vainely perswade themselues
they haue s&eacute;ene wandring spirits, or haue beheld one inst&eacute;ed
of an other: yet notwithstanding that there are walking
spirits, and that other strange things so sometime happen.</p>

<p>I haue also shewed vnto whome they appeare especially,
and where, when, after what sort, or in what fourmes
they shewe themselues, and what things they worke and
bring to passe.</p>

<p>Whosoeuer dare flatly deny these manifold and agr&eacute;eable
testimonies of the olde and new writers, he s&eacute;emeth
vnworthie in my iudgement, of any credit, whatsoeuer he
say. For as it is a great token of lightnesse, if one by and
by beleeue euery man which saith, he hath seene spirits: so
on the other side, it is great impudency, if a man rashly</p>

<p class="center">and impudently contemne all things which are aduouched,<br />
of so many, and so credible Historiographers,<br />
and auncient Fathers, and other<br />

<p class="center"><b>The opinion or beliefe of the Gentiles, Iewes, and Turkes,<br />
concerning the estate of Soules seperated from their bodies.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_il.png" alt="I" width="150" height="156" />
N the second part of this booke we haue
to consider, what those things be which
(as wee haue before shewed) are both
heard and s&eacute;ene, in the day time and in
the night, whether they be the soules of
dead men or no: also what the olde writers
haue iudged of them, and what the
holy scriptures, do teach vs herein.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Platos opinion.</div>

<p><b>Plato</b> doth think, that Heroicall and excellent soules, as
being of the pure sort, do mount aloft: but that other base
and viler soules, that are defiled with the pleasures &amp; lustes
of the bodie, do wander below on the ground, and the same
he d&eacute;emeth to be those spirits which are eftsoones s&eacute;ene.</p>

<p>Also other heathen and prophane writers say, they are
heereby mooued to thinke that the soules of men doo liue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
after death, for that it is most cleare and euident, that many
spirits wander and raunge hither and thither, and are
oft times heard and s&eacute;ene, and founde to talke with men:
<span class="sidenote">Tertullian.</span>
for they suppose that most of these are mens soules. <b>Tertullian</b>
a very auncient writer, in his booke <b><i>De anima</i></b>, saith,
that the wise Heathens, which did define the soule to be
immortall, (for some of them, as namely the Epicures,
thought that the soules died with their bodies) thought
that the soules of the wise, if they departed from their bodies,
hadde their abiding on high: but the rest were
throwne downe into Hell.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Heathen thought the Soules should
stray continually abroade before they founde rest, vnlesse
the bodies from which they were seuered, were rightly
buried in the earth. Wherefore (as we may reade in Poets)
it was a gr&eacute;euous crime to caste foorth any bodie vnburied.

<span class="sidenote">Homer.</span>

<b>Hector</b> in <b>Homere</b>,
besought <b>Achilles</b> that he
woulde not cast foorth his carcasse to be deuoured of Dogs
and birds, but that he would deliuer the same to be enterred
by olde <b>Priamus</b> his father, and <b>Hecuba</b> his mother.
<b>Patroclus</b> appeared in a vision by night after his deathe
vnto <b>Achilles</b>, and requested him to bestowe vppon him
all funeral solemnities. For otherwise he saide the soules
of those that were buried, woulde thrust him backe, that
he should not be able once to enter in at Hell gates. Which
example <b>Tertullian</b> aledgeth, and therwithal c&#333;futeth this
<span class="sidenote">Virgil.</span>
vaine opinion of the heathen. <b>Palinurus</b> in <b>Virgill</b>, besought
<b>Æneas</b>, that he woulde cast earth on him, when he was
dead, and erect vnto him an hearse, for so did they call those
Monuments of the deade, in whiche albeit no man was
layde, yet were they vsed in the honour of the deceassed.
<b>Virgill</b> writeth, that <b>Deiphobus</b> his Ghost wandred
abroade, vnto the whiche <b>Æneas</b> erected an Horse.</p>

<p>For the Gentiles were of suche an opinion in those
dayes, that they thought an emptie and counterfeyted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
buriall profitted very much. Moreouer the heathen were
perswaded that the soules which dyed before their naturall
time (especially of those whiche perished by violent death,
whom they call <span class="gktext">&beta;&iota;&omicron;&#952;&alpha;&nu;&#940;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,
as by hanging, drowning, or beheading,
&amp;c.) did straie abroade so long time as they should
haue liued, if they had not bin slain by violent death. Which
opinion <b>Tertullian</b> also confuteth.

<span class="sidenote">Plato.</span>

<b>Plato</b> in his ninth booke
<b><i>De legibus</i></b>, writeth, that the soules of those which are slain,
do pursue their murtherers so farre, that they do hurt them:
the which, except it be vnderstood by way of a Metaphor, is
likewise to be reiected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iewes
opinion.</div>

<p>The Catholike faith amongst the Iewes was, that the
soules of the dead did not returne into this earth, but either
were at rest, which was when they died in the faith of the
promised <b>Messias</b>, or were c&#333;demned if they departed hence
in their sinnes without repentance.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Iob</i>.7.</span>
For <b>Iob</b> in his seuenth
Chapter saith: Euen as the cloude vanisheth and fadeth away,
so he that goeth downe to the graue shall come vp no
more, nor returne into his house, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Psal.</i>31.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Eccle.</i>12.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wisd.</i>3.</div>

<p>But if thou wilt say that <b>Iob</b> was an Ethnicke, it may
be alleaged of <b>Dauid</b>, that when he was in very great danger,
and death euen present before his eyes, he praied in the
31. Psalme. Into thy hands O Lord I commend my spirit.
The Preacher also in his 12. Chapter saith: The spirite
shall returne to God that giueth it. In the booke of Wisedome
(which of olde writers is attributed to <b>Philo Iudeus</b>)
the third Chapter thereof, it is written: the soules of the
righteous are in the hande of God, and no torment shall
touch them. And on the other side, the soules of the wicked
<span class="sidenote"><i>Psal.</i>49.</span>
go downe into hell. In the 49. Psalm it is written of those
wealthie worldlings, which for lucres sake, depart from
God and his Commaundements: They are laid as sh&eacute;epe
in Hell, Death shall consume them, and Hell is their habitation,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>If the Iewes had bel&eacute;eued, that the soules after this life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
were tormented in Purgatorie, no doubt amongst so many
diuers kinds of sacrifices, which they offered for the sinnes
of the liuing, they would at least haue some one kind of sacrifice
whereby to red&eacute;eme soules, or in some part to assuage
and mitigate their paines. And that soules do returne after
death, do offer themselues to be s&eacute;ene and beheld of men,
and require aide of them, we finde no where in the old Testament,
<span class="sidenote">2. <i>Samu.</i> 12.</span>
but rather the contrary. In the 2. of <b>Samuel</b> 12. <b>Dauid</b>
speaketh this of his yoong childe, that he begat by <b>Bersaba</b>,
that he could not bring him into life againe, that hee
would go to him, and the childe should neuer returne vnto
<span class="sidenote"><i>Eccle.</i> 38.</span>
him againe. And Iesus the sonne of <b>Syrach</b>, in his 38. chapter
saith: There is no returning from death. Of the vision
which was shewed to <b>Samuel</b>, we will straightway speake
in his proper place.</p>

<p>And that in latter ages, long after Christ came in flesh,
there were some amongst the Iewes, who thought that the
soules separated from their bodies, did straie and raunge abroad:
it may hereby be gathered, for that certaine of the
Rabbines write, that the soule of <b>Naboth</b> (which was slain,
because he would not sell his Vineyard to <b>Achab</b>) was that
spirit that promised his helpe to seduce <b>Achab</b>, being as it
were one that coueted his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Turkes
opinion.</div>

<p>The Turkes also bel&eacute;eue that the soule is immortall,
and that assoone as they are loosed from the bodie, they come
either into a place of rest, or of torment. But whether that
they did thinke, that soules returned againe into the earth,
and roue there too and fro, I could finde no plaine mention
thereof in their <b><i>Alcaron</i></b>.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The Papists doctrine touching the soules of dead men, and<br />
the appearing of them.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_ts.png" alt="T" width="150" height="164" /></p>

<div class="sidenote">Papists.</div>

<p>He Papists in former times haue publikely
both taught and written, that those spirites
which men somtime s&eacute;e and heare, be either
good or bad angels, or els the soules of those
which either liue in euerlasting blisse, or in
Purgatory, or in the place of damned persons.
And that diuers of them are those soules that craue
aide and deliuerance of men. But that this doctrine of
theirs, and the whole state therof may be the more euidently
perceiued, we will more largely repeate the same out of
<span class="sidenote">Iacobus de Cusa.</span>
their owne bookes. <b>Iacobus de Cusa</b>, a <b><i>Carthusian</i></b> Friar, and
Doctor of diuinitie, wrote a booke of y&#868; Apparition of soules,
after they were seperated fro the bodies: which worke of
his, hath in it many superstitious toyes, and was Printed
in a Towne belonging to the dominion of <b><i>Berna</i></b>, named
<b><i>Burgdrofe</i></b>, in the yeare of our Lord, 1475.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foure places
for soules.</div>

<p>Popish writers commenting on the 4. booke of the Maister
of Sentences, do appoint foure places to receiue soules,
after they are departed from the bodies. Thr&eacute;e of the which
places they say are perpetuall, and one which lasteth but
for a time already limitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heauen.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Limbus puerorum which is a place wher
the Papistes imagine the soules of yong childr&#275; to be,
which departed without Baptisme.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Purgatorie.</div>

<p>The first place or receptacle is <b><i>C&aelig;lum Empireum</i></b>, the
firie heauen, so termed of his passing great brightnesse and
glory, which they say is the seate ordeined for y&#868; blissed sort:
this place by an other name in scripture is called <b>Paradise</b>.
The second place is Hell vnder the earth, being the Mansion
of Diuels and Infidels, departing hence in deadly
sinne, without repentance. The third place they tearme
<b><i>Limbus puerorum</i></b>, which is prouided as well for the children
of the faithfull, as of the vnfaithfull: who (they say)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
shall continually abyde there without any sense of payne,
being only depriued from the fruition of Gods presence.
And therefore they say, that after their death, they ought
not to be buried in holy buriall. The fourth place is Purgatorie,
which is prepared for them that departe hence
without deadly sinne, or if they committed any such sinnes,
did some penance for them, but yet made not full satisfaction
for them, or else went hence only stained with venial sin.</p>

<p>Of this place, to wit, Purgatorie, Popish writers teach
maruellous things. Some of them say, that Purgatorie
is also vnder the earth as Hell is. Some say that Hell and
Purgatorie are both one place, albeit the paines be diuers
according to the deserts of soules. Furthermore they say,
that vnder the earth there are more places of punishment
in which the soules of the deade may be purged. For they
say, that this or that soule hath bin seene in this or that
mountaine, cloud, or valley, where it hath committed the
offence: and that these are particuler Purgatories, assigned
vnto them for some speciall cause, before the day of Iudgement,
after which time all manner of Purgatories, as well
general as particuler shall cease. Some of them say, that
the paine of Purgatorie is all one with the punishment of
hel, and that they differ only in this, that the one hath an end,
the other no ende: and that it is far more easie to endure
all the paynes of this worlde, whiche all men since <b>Adams</b>
time haue susteined, euen vnto the day of the last Iudgement,
than to beare one dayes space the least of these two
punishmentes.</p>

<p>Further they holde that our fire, if it be compared with
the fire of Purgatorie, doth resemble only a painted fire.

<p>This question also they moue, by whome the Soules
in Purgatorie are tormented. Wherfore their opinions are
very diuers, and disagr&eacute;eable among themselues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Richardus de Media Villa</b> a
<b><i>Franciscan</i></b> Frier, writeth vpon
the Maister of Sentences, and saith, he verily bel&eacute;eueth
that soules are caried by good Angels, into the places of
torment, but yet that they themselues do not torment them,
because they shall become at length fellow citizens with
them. Neyther yet are they punished by Deuils (who
after this life do no longer tempte men) but only by the
m&eacute;ere iustice of God. And yet (saith he) it may so come
to passe, that the Deuils be present at the doing thereof,
and reioyce at their tortures. I thought good to repeate
these things of Purgatorie somewhat at large, the rather
for that the reader might s&eacute;e, that their Doctours do disagr&eacute;e
in a matter of great weight, by which they haue both
robbed men of their wealth, and plunged them into very
great miserie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papists feigne
that soules returne
to earth
againe.</div>

<p>H&eacute;ervnto they adde, that the spirits, as well of the good,
as the ill, do come and are sent vnto men liuing, from hell.
And that by the common lawe of iustice, all men at the
day of Iudgement shall come to their trial from hell: and
that none before that time can come from thence. Farther
they teache, that by Gods licence and dispensation, certaine,
yea before the day of Iudgement, are permitted to
come out of hell, and that not for euer, but only for a season,
for the instructing and terrifying of the liuing. H&eacute;ervppon
they recite diuers kindes of visions, that certaine
Clarkes, and Laye persons being damned, bothe men
and women, haue appeared to their ghostly fathers, and
others, and haue opened vnto them the causes of their damnation:
all which to rehearse h&eacute;ere were lost laboure. And
that the soules which be in euerlasting ioye, or in Purgatorie,
do often appeare, it may be s&eacute;ene in <b>Gregories</b> Homelies
and <b>Gregories</b> Dialogues, who writeth that <b>Peter</b>
and <b>Paule</b>, and other Saintes, did not onely appeare
vnto holie men, but did also conducte their Soules
vnto Celestiall ioye. Moreouer that God doth licence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
soules to return from those two places, partly for the comfort
and warning of the liuing, and partly to pray aide of
them. And yet that those soules doo not here represent themselues
to be s&eacute;ene of men, when, and how often soeuer they
list themselues. No doubt these men shewe themselues to
haue a sharpe wit and profound knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VVhether we
may wish to
see spirits.</div>

<p>These Doctors moreouer moue this question, whether
we may request without offence, that the soules of such as
are departed, may shewe themselues to be beheld and s&eacute;ene
of the liuing.</p>

<p>To riue asunder this crabbed knotte, they bring this
wedge: that if this request proceede of some good intent,
without the spot of lightnesse &amp; vanitie, that a man might
vnderstand the state of some friend, neighbour, benefactour,
or of his parents, or some other, therby to helpe and relieue
them speedily of their torments, it is no offence at all: because
dead mens soules doo of their owne accord shew them
selues vnto the liuing, to receiue helpe of them, and therefore
nothing can let vs to aske this thing at Gods hand. Of
this opinion is <b>Thomas</b> of <b>Aquine</b>.</p>

<p>But as concernyng the time and place, when and
where Spirites doo proffer themselues to be s&eacute;ene, they
say, no certaine rule can be giuen: for this standeth
wholly in Gods pleasure, who if he list to deliuer any, suffereth
him to make his appearaunce foorthwith, euen in
such places as he may be well heard in. And that spirits do
not alwayes appeare vnder a visible shape, but sometimes
inuisibly, in so much that sometime nothing else is heard
of them but sn&eacute;esing, spitting, sighing, and clapping of hands
&amp;c. Of which point I haue noted somewhat before, when
I spake generally of ghostes, because they appeare in sundry
sorts. And wheresoeuer these spirits be, they say, that
they endure punishment. Besides that soules doo not appeare,
nor answere vnto euery mans interrogatories,
but that of a great number they scantly appeare vnto one.

<span class="sidenote">How a man ought to vse himself when
spirits appeare according to the Papists.</span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Dan.</i>10.11.</span>
And therefore they teache. Whensoeuer such visions of spirits
are shewed, men should vse fasting and praier or euer
they demaunde any question of them: which (say they) in
the tenth and eleuenth Chapters of <b>Daniell</b>, is read to haue
bene done by <b>Daniell</b> himself. Besides this, shrift, and massing
should be vsed ere we question with them: farther, that
we should not giue credit assoone as we heare but one sign,
but waite to heare the same thrice repeated, which in the
<span class="sidenote">1.<i>Samu.</i>3.</span>
first booke of <b>Samuel</b> and third Chapter, is read to haue bin
done by <b>Samuel</b> being yet a childe: for otherwise the diuell
may delude and deceiue vs, as he doth very often. And so
soone as these thinges are dispatched and performed, that
foure or fiue deuout priests are to be sent for, which should
come to the place where the spirit was wont to shew himselfe,
and that they should vse certaine ceremonies, as to
take a candle that hath bene halowed on Candlemasse day,
and light it: also holy water, the signe of the Crosse, a censor
in their hand, and when they light their candle, should
pray ouer it (as I remember) the seuen penitential psalms,
or read the Gospell of S. <b>Iohn</b>. And when they come to the
place, they should sprinkle it with holy water, and perfume
it with Frankincense, casting about their neckes a holy
stoale, and then that one of them kneeling on his kn&eacute;es,
should rehearse this praier following.</p>

<p>O Lord Iesu Christ, the searcher of all secrets, which art
alwaies wont to reueale healthfull and profitable things
vnto thy faithful people and litle ones, which hast permitted
some certaine spirit to shew himselfe in this place: we
humbly bes&eacute;ech thee of thy great mercy, by thy death &amp; passion,
and by the sheading of thy most precious bloud for our
sinnes, that thou wilt vouchsafe to giue in charge to this
spirite, that he may declare and open what he is, without
any fraying or hurting of vs, or of any other creature besides:
shewing vnto vs thy seruants, or to other sinners as
we be, who he is, why he is come, and what he desireth, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that hereby thou maist be honoured, he comforted, and thy
faithfull people also holpen and succoured. In the name of
the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost. Amen.</p>

<p>Yet do they teach, that a man may choose to vse this or
some other forme of praier, and ceremonies: because that
without these, spirites haue often appeared, &amp; shewed what
they required. This done, we should (as they teach) fall to
questioning with them, and say: Thou spirite, we bes&eacute;ech
th&eacute;e by Christ Iesus, tell vs what thou art, and if there be
any amongst vs, to whome thou wouldest gladly make answere,
name him, or by some signe declare so much? After
this, the question is to be moued,, eache man there present
being recited whether he would answere vnto this or that
man. And if at the name of any, h&eacute;e speake, or make a
noyse, all other demaunds remaining, should be made vnto
him: As these and suche lyke. What mans soule he is?
for what cause he is come, and what he doth desire? Whether
he require any aide by prayers and suffrages? Whether
by Massing, or almes giuing he may be released? Farther,
by how many Masses that may be compassed, by thr&eacute;e,
six, ten, twentie, thirtie. &amp;c. Furthermore, what manner of
priests should say Masse for him, Monks, or secular priests.
Then if he aske for any fasting, by what persons, how long,
and in what sort he wold haue it done: If he require almes
d&eacute;eds, what almes d&eacute;eds they should be, how many, and on
what persons bestowed, whether on him that lacketh harbour,
or that is diseased of the leprosie, or on some other sort
of people.</p>

<p>Furthermore, by what signe it may be perfectly knowne
that he is released, and for what cause he was first shut vp
in Purgatorie. And yet they hold, y&#877; no curious, vnprofitable,
or superstitious questi&#333;s shuld be demanded of y&#868; spirit,
except he wold of his own accord reueale and open th&#275;. And
y&#877; it were best, y&#877; sober persons shuld thus questi&#333; w&#877; him, on
som holiday before diner, or in y&#868; night seas&#333;, as is comm&#333;ly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
accustomed. And if the spirite will shewe no signe at that
time, the matter should be deferred vnto some other season,
vntill the spirit would shewe himselfe againe: and yet that
the crosse and holy water should bee left there, for that by
the secret iudgement of God, it was ordeined, that they
should appeare at certaine houres, and to certaine persons,
and not vnto all men. And farther, they say that we n&eacute;ede
not to feare, that the spirite would doo any bodily hurt vnto
that person, vnto whome it doth appeare. For if such a
spirit would hurt any, he might justly be suspected that he
were no good spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By what tokens good spirites may be
discerned from euil.<br /><i>Luke</i> 1.</div>

<p>Moreouer, popish writers teach vs to discerne good spirits
from euill, by foure meanes. First they say, that if he
be a good spirit, he will at the beginning, somewhat terrifie
men, but againe soone reuiue and comfort them. So <b>Gabriel</b>
with comfortable words did lift vp the blessed Virgin
which before was sore troubled by this salutation. They
also alleage other examples. The second note is to discrie
them by their outwarde and visible shape. For if they appeare
vnder the forme of a Lyon, Beare, Dog, Toade, Serpent,
Cat, or blacke ghoste, it may easily be gathered that it
is an euil spirit. And that on the other side, good spirits doo
appeare vnder the shape of a doue, a man, a lambe, or in the
brightnesse, and cleare light of the Sunne.</p>

<p>We must also consider whether the voyce whiche we
heare be sweete, lowly, sober, sorrowfull, or otherwise terrible
and full of reproach, for so they terme it.</p>

<p>Thirdly we must note, whether the spirit teache ought
that doth varie from the doctrine of the Apostles, and other
Doctors approoued by the Churches censure: or whether
he vtter any thing that doth dissent from the faith, good maners,
and ceremonies of the Church, according to the Canonical
rites or decr&eacute;es of Councels, and against the lawes
of the holy church of <b><i>Rome</i></b>.</p>

<p>Fourthly, we must take diligent h&eacute;ede whether in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
words, d&eacute;eds, and iestures, he do shewe forth any humilitie,
acknowledging or confessing of his sinnes &amp; punishments,
or whether we heare of him any groning, w&eacute;eping, complaint,
boasting, threatning, slaunder or blasphemie. For as
the beggar doth rehearse his owne miserie, so likewise doo
good spirits that desire any helpe or deliueraunce. Other
signes also they haue to trie the good Angels from the bad:
but these are the chiefe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How we may
helpe and succoure
soules.</div>

<p>Now touching the suffrages or waies of succour, wherby
soules are dispatched out of Purgatorie, Popish doctors
appoint foure meanes: That is, the healthfull offering of
the sacrifice in the Sacrament of the aultar, almes giuing,
prayer, fasting. And vnder these members, they comprise
all other, as vowed pilgrimages, visiting of Churches, helping
of the poore, and the furthering of Gods worship and
glory, &amp;c. But aboue all, they extoll their Masse, as a thing
of greatest force to red&eacute;eme soules out of misery: of whose
wonderfull effect, and of the rest euen now recited by vs,
they alleage many straunge examples.</p>

<p>Of these things they moue many questions, the which
who so lust to s&eacute;e, let him search their bookes which haue bin
written and published of this matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A notable
deede to relieue
soules.</div>

<p>Neither only in their writings, but in open pulpit also
they haue taught, how excellent and noble an act it is, for
men touched with compassion, with these foresaid workes
to ridde the soule that appeareth vnto them and craueth
their help, out of the paines of purgatorie: or if they cannot
so doo, yet to ease and asswage their torture. For say they,
the soules after their deliuerance, ceasse not in moste earnest
maner to pray for their benefactors, and helpers. On
the other side, they teach that it is an horrible and heynous
offence, if a man giue no succoure to suche as s&eacute;eke it at his
hands, especially if it be the soule of his parents, brethren
and sisters. For except by them they might conueniently
be released of so manifolde miseries, they woulde not so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
earnestly craue their helpe. Wherefore say they, no man
should be so voyd of naturall affection, so cruell and outragious,
that he should at any time deny to bestowe some small
wealth, to benefit those, by whom he hath before by diuers
and sundry waies bene pleasured.</p>

<p>If they were not the soules of the dead which craue helpe
and succour, but diuellish spirits, they would not will them
to pray, fast, or giue almes for their sakes: for that the diuels
doo hate those, as also all other good workes.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><b>What hath followed this doctrine of the Papists, concerning<br />
the appearing of mens soules.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_bl.png" alt="B" width="150" height="155" />

Y these means it came to passe, that the
common sort were of opini&#333;, that those
spirits which wer s&eacute;en and heard, were
the soules of the dead, and y&#877; whatsoeuer
they did say, was without gainsaying to
be bel&eacute;eued. And so the true, simple, and
sincere doctrine of y&#868; calling vp&#333; God in
the name of Christ Iesus only: of the confidence in Christs
merits, and redemption from sin and damnation: of y&#868; true
d&eacute;eds of Christian charitie, was daily more and more impugned
and oppressed. So that when men by litle and litle,
forsooke holy scripture, and cast it aside, mens traditions and
precepts began straightway to be had in great price and estimation,
yea, they were more regarded than Gods owne
word. A great offence was it taken to be, if any would presume
once to breake mens traditions. On those apparitions
of spirits, as on a sure foundati&#333; of their Purgatory is chiefly
builded. For by talke had with them, Popish writers
taught that men atteined vnto saluation, by their owne,
and by other mens merits: which opinion so blinded them,
that they became retchlesse, secure, and sluggish. For if any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
dyd so perswade himselfe, that he coulde hyre one for
mony, which could worke one feate or other to deliuer the
deade from torments, then woulde he either delay the amendment
of his life, or vtterly neglect it. Wherfore vnto
suche fellowes, that happened, whiche chaunced vnto the
fiue foolish virgins, of whom mention is made in the .25. of
Matthew. By these apparitions of spirits, masses, images,
satisfaction, pilgrimages for religion sake, relikes of saints,
monasticall vowes, holidaies, auricular confession, and other
kinds of worshippings and rites, and to be short, all
things whiche haue no grounde in holy scripture, by little
and little grewe into authoritie and estimation. So that
the matter came at the last to that extremitie and excesse,
that many deuoute, and simple soules, pinched and nipped
their owne bellies, that they might y&#868; better haue by these
meanes, wherewithall to finde and mainteine idle monks
and priests, and to offer vnto images. They founded chappels,
alters, monasteries, perpetuall lights, anniuersaries,
frieries, and such like, to release their friends out of the
torments of Purgatorie. And this did the walking spirits
will them to do. And sometime also by their councell, mens
<span class="sidenote">Monkes by their doctrine of spirits haue
heaped infinit riches.</span>
last willes &amp; testaments were altered. Hereby priests and
monks increased daily, their parishes, colleges &amp; monasteries
with yerely reuenewes, &amp; got into their hands y&#868; best
farmes, vineyards, lands, medowes, pondes, parkes, bond
men, iurisdictions, great lordships, and the authoritie of the
sword. For after y&#877; this opini&#333; once tooke firme roote in m&#275;s
harts, y&#877; mens soules did walke after their death, &amp; appeare
on y&#868; earth, the greatest part did whatsoeuer they commanded
th&#275;. And y&#877; it may more plainly be perceiued how much
m&#275; est&eacute;emed those visions &amp; such like pelf, &amp; how in memorial
of th&#275; they deuised &amp; framed to th&#275;selues new kinds of
worshippings, I will recite vnto you one or two histories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Martinus Polonus.</div>

<p><b>Martinus Polonus</b> Archebishop Of <b>Consentine</b>, and the
Popes Penit&#275;tiarie, writeth in his Chronicles, that Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
<b>Clement</b> the fourth did canonize for a Saint at <b><i>Viterbe</i></b>, one
<b>Eduergia</b>, Duchesse of <b><i>Polonia</i></b>, a widdow of great holinesse,
who (among many notable things that are written of her)
when her canonization had bene many yeares delaied, at
length appeared her selfe in a Vision to her Proctor in the
Court of <b><i>Rome</i></b>, being heauie and pensiue about this matter,
and certified him, both of the sp&eacute;edie dispatching of this
businesse, and also of the day wherin it should be dispatched.
Canonization amongst the Ethnicks, from whence it tooke
his originall, is named <span class="gktext">&#7937;&pi;&omicron;&theta;&#7953;&omicron;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
that is, deification, or making of a God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All soules day
wh&#275;ce it took
originall.</div>

<p><b>Ioannes Tritenhemius</b> Abbotte of <b><i>Spanheim</i></b>, a man of
great authoritie, in his booke of Chronicles teacheth, that
the memorie of all faithfull soules, termed All soules day,
had his originall obseruation by this meanes: that when a
certaine Monke returned from <b><i>Ierusalem</i></b>, and lodged in a
certaine Hermits house in <b><i>Sicill</i></b>, about the mount <b><i>Aetna</i></b>,
which flasheth foorth fire, h&eacute;e learned of the saide Hermit,
that many soules of the dead were tormented there by fire,
out of which again through the praiers of the faithful, they
were released, as it was taught him by the testimony euen
<span class="sidenote">Polydore.</span>
of the spirites themselues. Hereof also writeth <b>Polydore
Virgil</b>, in his sixt booke, and 9. Chapter, <b><i>De inuentione rerum</i></b>,
that the feast of All hallowes had the very same originall,
whiche they shall finde in <b><i>Petrus de natalibus</i></b> his
tenth booke, and first Chapter. Wherby thou maist gather,
that Feastes were first ordeyned by the tales of spirites
appearing vnto men. The like fable is founde in <b>Damascene</b>,
who writeth of <b>Macharius</b> thus: When according to
his maner he prayed for the dead, and was desirous to vnderstande
whether his prayers did profitte them ought,
and whether they receiued any comfort thereby, God willing
to reueale so muche to his seruaunt, inspired a drie
scull with the word of truth, so that the dead scull brake
forth into these words: When thou praiest for the dead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
we receiue comfort by thy praiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beginning
of the order of Carthusians.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Polydore.</div>

<p>Of the like roote sprung the order of the <b>Carthusian</b>
Monkes, which of the common sort is iudged to be the most
holiest and straightest order of the which the Monks themselues
of this broode haue put foorth a booke. For as <b>Polydore
Virgil</b> recordeth, they began vpon this occasion in the
Vniuersitie of <b><i>Paris</i></b>, in the yeare of our Lord 1080. A certaine
Doctor which for his learning and integritie of life
was very famous, chaunced to die, when he should haue
bene buried in a certaine Church, he cried out with an horrible
voyce: I am by the iust iudgement of God accused.
Wherupon they left the Coffin in the Church by the space
of thr&eacute;e dayes, during which time the people flocked togither
out of sundry places, to behold this straunge sight. The
second day he cried againe: By the iust iudgement of God
I am iudged. The third day likewise he cried: I am by the
iust iudgement of God condemned. And as <b>Vincentius Bellonacensis</b>
saith, some adde hereunto, that he rose vp thrice
vpon the b&eacute;ere, which perchaunce they faine of their owne
heads. Now because no man suspected that so notable and
famous a man was vtterly condemned for euer, euery man
was sore astonished thereat.</p>

<p>Wherfore <b>Bruno</b>, a Doctor of diuinitie borne in <b><i>Coleine</i></b>,
foorthwith forsooke all that he had, and taking to him sixe
other godly companions, gat him into a desart called <b><i>Carthusia</i></b>,
in the diocesse of <b><i>Grationopolis</i></b>: where he erected the
first monasterie of that order, which drawing his name of
the place, was called the <b>Carthusian</b> order. For this cause
also, or for the like, many other monasteries at the first beginning,
were both founded and endowed with great liuelihood.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NOw that the soules neither of the faithfull nor of infidels
do wander any longer on the earth, when they be

vnto you by these reasons following. First, certaine it
is, that such as depart hence, either die in faith, or in vnbeliefe.
Touching those that go hence in a right beliefe, their
soules are by and by in possessi&#333; of life euerlasting, and they
that depart in vnbelief, do straightway becom partakers of
eternal damnati&#333;. The souls do not vanish away &amp; die with

place, as som do imagin: touching this matter I wil alleage
pithie &amp; manifold testimonies out of the holy scripture, out

Our Sauiour Christ Iesus which could well iudge

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn 3.</i></span>

god sent not his son into y&#868; world to c&#333;demn y&#868; world: but that

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn 6.</i></span>

sins shuld first be purged in purgatorie. And in the 6. cha. he
saith: This is y&#868; wil of him y&#877; sent me, that euery one y&#877; seeth
the son, and beleeueth on him, should haue life euerlasting,
and I will raise him vp at the last day againe: verily I say
vnto you, he that bel&eacute;eueth on me hath life euerlasting.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn 14.</i></span>

In the 14. of <b>Iohn</b>, also our Sauior Christ Iesus saith, that
he wil take vs vp to himselfe, that where he is, there should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
we be also. &amp;c. When Christ sent forth his disciples to publish

<span class="sidenote"><i>Mat.10.</i></span>

his gospel in y&#868; 10. of <b>Mat.</b> he said vnto them: Go ye into
the whole world, and preach y&#868; gospel to euery creature: he
y&#877; bel&eacute;eueth and is baptized, shalbe saued, and he y&#877; beleeueth

<span class="sidenote"><i>2.Cor.5.</i></span>

not shalbe c&#333;demned: &amp; in the 5. cha. of y&#868; 2. to y&#868; <b>Cor.</b> y&#868; apostle
S. <b>Paul</b> saith: we know y&#877; if the earthly house of this tabernacle
be destroied, we haue a building of God, y&#877; is, a house
not made [tw] hands, but eternal in y&#868; heuens, &amp;c. By these places
it may be euidently gathered, y&#877; the soules of the faithful
are tak&#275; vp into eternal ioy: and the soules of the vnfaithful
assoone as they are departed fr&#333; their bodies are condemned
to perpetual torment. And y&#877; this is done straightway after
death, may be perceiued by the words y&#877; Christ spake to the
th&eacute;efe on the crosse, when he hoong on his right hand: This

<span class="sidenote"><i>Luke 23.</i></span>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Apo.14.</i></span>

day shalt thou be with me in paradice. And in the 14. cha. of the
<b>Apoc.</b> it is written, And I heard a voice y&#877; said vnto
me, write, Blessed ar y&#868; dead y&#877; die in the lord, <span
class="gktext">&#7937;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#7985;</span>
<b>amodo</b>, as the old tr&#257;slati&#333; redeth, y&#877; is by
&amp; by, out of hand, without delaie. Steu&#275; in the very point
wh&#275; he looked to be stoned, cried lord Iesu receiue my spirit.
He douted nothing, but was assuredly persuaded y&#877; his soul shold
straitway be translated to eternal ioy. Paul in the 1. chap. of his
epist. to the <b>Philip.</b> saith: I desire to be losed, or I couet
to depart hence, and to be with Christ. Here is no menti&#333; at
all of purgatory, in which the soules should be first purged. If
thou wilt here obiect that the persons afore alleaged were saints
and martirs, we say farther, that paradice was opened also to the
th&eacute;ef assoone as he became repentant. And that the soules both
of the faithful &amp; vnfaithful, which presently after their death
are translated to heau&#275; or hel, do not return thence into the
earth before the day of the last iudgement, may wel be perceiued by
the parable of the rich man cloathed in purple, and <b>Lazarus</b>,
as we read in the 16. of <b>Luke</b>. For when the rich man praised
<b>Abraham</b> that he would send <b>Lazarus</b> vnto him, to coole
his toong, <b>Abraham</b> gaue him this answere: Betwixt this <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and vs, there is a great gulfe set, so that they which would go
hence (from <b>Abrahams</b> bosome) to you (in Hell) cannot: neither
can they come from thence to vs. And when he besought him, that he
would send <b>Lazarus</b> to his fathers house to admonish his fiue
brethren, least they also should come into that place of torment:
he saide vnto him; They haue <b>Moses</b> and the Prophets, let
them heare them. And again: If they heare not <b>Moses</b> and the
Prophets, neither will they bel&eacute;eue though one rose againe
from the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Testimonies of the auncient Fathers, that dead mens soules<br />

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_ts.png" alt="T" width="150" height="164" /></p>

<div class="sidenote">August.</div>

<p>His matter was also thus vnderstood by the
holy and auncient Fathers. For <b>Augustine</b>
in his 18. Sermon <b><i>De verbis Apostoli</i></b>, hath,
that there be two mansions, the one in euerlasting
fire, the other in the euerlasting
kingdome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Idem.</div>

<p>And in his 28. Chapter of his first booke, <b><i>De peccatorum
meritis &amp; remissione contra Pelagianos</i></b>, in the seuenth tome of
his workes, he saith: Neither can any man haue any middle
or meane place, so that he may be any other where than
with the diuel, who is not with Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Idem.</div>

<p>And in his notable worke <b><i>De ciuitate Dei</i></b>, the 13. booke
and 8. Chapter, he saith: The soules of the godly so soone as
they be seuered from their bodies be in rest, and the soules
of the wicked in torment, vntil the bodies of the one be raised
vnto life, and the other vnto euerlasting death, which
in scripture is called the second death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iustine.</div>

<p><b>Iustine</b> also an auncient Father, writeth in <b><i>Responsione
ad Orthodoxos, quest. 75.</i></b> that the difference of the iust and
vniust, both appeare euen assoone as the soule is departed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
from the body. For they are carried by the angels into such
places as are fit for them: that is, the soules of the iust are
brought vnto Paradice, where they haue the fruition of the
sight and presence of Angels, and Archangels: and moreouer
the sight of our Sauiour Christ, as it is conteined in
that saying, whiles we are straungers from the bodie, we
are at home with God. And the soules of the vnrighteous
on the other side, are carried to Hell, as it said of <b>Nabuchodonozor</b>
the king of <b><i>Babylon</i></b>: Hell is troubled vnder th&eacute;e,
being readie to m&eacute;ete th&eacute;e, &amp;c. And so till to the day of resurrection
and reward, are they reserued in such places as are
m&eacute;etest for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hillarie.</div>

<p>Saint <b>Hillarie</b> in the ende of his exposition of the second
Psalme, writeth: that mens soules are straightway after
death, made partakers of rewards or punishments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dormitantii.</div>

<p>And touching the soules of the old Patriarkes, that died
before the natiuitie of Christ, <b>Austin</b>,
<b>Hierom</b>, <b>Nazianzen</b>,
and other holy Fathers teache, that God in certaine places
by him chosen out for that purpose, hath preserued the
soules of al those that are departed from this life in the true
faith of the <b>Messias</b> to come, in such sort that they f&eacute;ele no
griefe, but yet are depriued of the sight of God. This place
they call <b>Abrahams</b> bosome, and Hell (for Hell doth not alwaies
betoken a place of torment, but also generally the
state that soules are in after this life.) And that our Lord
Iesus Christ did visit and release them, and when he ascended,
carried them with himselfe into heauen. Albeit certain
of the Fathers, as <b>Ireneus</b>,
<b>Tertullian</b>, <b>Hilarie</b>, &amp; others,
think that they shall at the last day ascend to heauen. Some
also there be of our time which maintaine this fonde opinion,
that the soules sl&eacute;ep, vntil the day of the last iudgement,
in which they shall be again coupled with their bodies: but
this assertion hath no ground in holy scripture, of the which

<span class="sidenote">Caluin.</span>

point diuers haue entreated. But especially <b>Iohn Caluin</b>,
that worthie seruant of God, in a proper Treatise that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
wrote of the same matter, in which he doth learnedly confute
their reasons that maintein the contrary opinion.</p>

<p>Wherefore sith holy scriptures, as the Fathers vnderstand
and interpret them, teache that the soules of men, as
soone as they departe from the bodies, do ascende vp into
heauen if they were godly, descende into hell if they were
wicked and faithlesse, and that their is no thirde place in
which soules should be deliuered, as it were out of prison,
&amp; that soules can neither be reclaimed out of heauen or hel.
Hereby it is made euident, that they cannot wander on the
earth, and desire aide of men. For first the soules of the blessed
n&eacute;ed no aid or help that men c&#257; giue them: &amp; on the other

<span class="sidenote">Ciprian mar.</span>

side, the damned sort can no way be rel&eacute;eued: the which S.
<b>Ciprian</b> the martir in his oration
against <b>Demetrian</b>, doth
plainly witnesse in these words: when we be once departed
out of this world, there is afterward no place left for repentance,
no way to make satisfacti&#333;: here life is either woon or
lost, &amp; so forth. Albeit the testimonies alredy alleged on this
point of doctrine, may well suffise those that loue the truth,
and are desirous to come to the knowledge thereof: yet to increase
the number, I wil recite other testimonies also out of

<span class="sidenote">Soules do not
walke.</span>

y&#868; fathers, to proue manifestly, y&#877; the soules departed, do not
againe return &amp; wander on the earth, so that all they which
haue not yet stopped their eares that the truth might not
pierce &amp; enter into them, may euidently perceiue, that those
anci&#275;t times taught a far better doctrine of those spirits and
ghosts, than other latter times vnder poperie haue c&#333;mended

<span class="sidenote">Tertullian.</span>

and allowed. <b>Tertullian</b> a very auncient writer, in the
end of his booke <b>De anima</b>, saith, the soules do not any longer
abide on the earth, after they be once loosed from their
bodies: &amp; that neither by their owne accord, nor other mens
c&#333;mandement, they do wander at all after they haue descended
into hell, but he saith, that euil spirits do vse this kinde
of deceyt, to faine themselues to be the soules of suche as
are deceased. And that Hell is not open to any soule,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that it should afterward at any time depart thence, Christ
our Lorde in the parable of the poore man that was in rest,
and the rich glutton that was in torment, doth plainely
ratifie vnder the person of <b>Abraham</b>, that there can be no
man sent backe to shewe or tel ought of the state of hel. And
albeit the fathers haue noted certaine errours and scapes in
<b>Tertullian</b>, yet there was neuer any that reproued him for

<span class="sidenote">Athanasius.</span>

this opinion. <b>Athanasius</b> in his booke of questions, the xiii.
questi&#333;, doth giue a reason wherfore God will not suffer that
any soule deceased, shuld returne vnto vs, and declare what
the state of things is in hel, and what great misery is there:
hereby (saith he) many errors wold easily spring vp among
vs: for many diuels might so take on th&#275; the shape of men,
and be transformed into y&#868; likenesse of the dead, and say, that
they arose fr&#333; the dead, and so publish many lying tales, and
false opinions of things there don, therby to seduce and hurt
vs. Weigh these wordes of <b>Athanasius</b>, I pray th&eacute;e.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chrisostome.</div>

<p>Sainct Chrysostome in his nyneteenth Homilie on the
eight chapter of sainct Matthewes Gospell, hath in maner
the same woordes, for hee moueth this question: Why
suche as were possessed with Spirites, liued in graues?
Therefore (sayeth he) they abode there, to put this false
opinion in mens heads, that those persons soules whiche
by violent death departed, were turned into Diuels, and so
did seruice vnto witches and soothsayers. The which opinion
the diuell first broughte in, thereby to diminishe the
Martyrs prayse and glorie, that so the Sorcerers might
slea those persons, whose wicked trauell and help they vsed,
and those matters saith he, are far from truth. For he proueth
by the Scripture, that the spirits of the godly are not
vnder the power of the Diuels, nor yet do stray abroade
after death: then that they woulde retourne vnto theyr
owne bodies, if they mighte wander whether they lusted.
And further if they didde any seruice too theyr
Murtherers, by that meanes they should at their handes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
receiue a reward for an ill d&eacute;ed and displeasure. By naturall
reason also it cannot come to passe, that a mans bodie should
be turned into an other bodie, and therefore also the spirit
of a man cannot be changed into a diuel.</p>

<p>But among other things which properly belong to our
purpose, he saith: If we heare a noyse that saith, I am such
a soule, we must thus thinke, that this talke proceedeth of
some sleight and subtiltie of the diuel, and that it is not the
soule of the dead bodie that speaketh these things, but the diuell
that deuiseth them to deceiue the hearers. And by and
by he saith, that there are to be counted old wiues words, or
rather doting fooles toyes to mocke children withall. For
the soule when it is parted from the bodie cannot walke any
longer in these parties. For the soules of the iust are in
the hands of God. And on the other side, the soules of the
wicked after their departure hence, are straightway ledde
aside and withdrawne from vs, which may euidently be
s&eacute;ene by Lazarus and the rich man. And in another place also
the Lord saith: This day will they take thy soule from
th&eacute;e; wherefore the soule cannot heere wander when it is
departed from the bodie.</p>

<p>A little afterward he addeth, that it may be proued out
of many places of scripture, that the soules of the iust do not
here wander after death. For <b>Steuen</b> said, Lord receiue my
spirit, and <b>Paule</b> desired to be loosed and to depart hence, and
to be with Christ.</p>

<p>Also the scripture, as touching the Patriarks death, vseth
this phrase, he is laide vnto his fathers, growne vp vnto a
good olde age. And that the soules of sinners and wicked
men, cannot after their departure, here abide any longer,
we may learne by the riche mans words, if we will weigh
and confider with our selues what be demannded and could
not obtaine. For if after death mens soules might any longer
haue their conuersation heere on earth, no doubt the
riche man himselfe woulde haue returned as his desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was, and certified his friendes of hell torments. Out of
which place of scripture it is most cleare, that soules immediatly
vpon their departure from their body, are carried
vnto a certaine place, whence they cannot of themselues returne,
but n&eacute;edes must waite there for that terrible day of
iudgement.</p>

<p>Also in his second Homily of <b>Lazarus</b>, am&#333;g other things,
he saith; It is most plaine, not only by that we haue before
rehearsed, but also by this parable, that soules parted from
the bodie, haue their abiding here no longer, but are forthwith
lead away. For it came to passe (saith he) that he died,
and was carried away by the Angels. And not onely the
soules of the iust, but of the vniust and wicked, are hence led
away, and carried to their proper places, which doth euidently
appeare, by another rich man, of which mention is
made in the 12. of <b>Luke</b>, to whom the Lord said: Thou foole
this night will they take thy soule from th&eacute;e.</p>

<p>And in his fourth Homily of <b>Lazarus</b>, he plainly teacheth,
that we should giue more credite to holy scripture,
than to one that came from the dead, or an Angell from
Heauen. Herewithall he also sheweth, that the dead doo not
only make no appearance vnto men liuing, but yeldeth reasons
wherefore they do not returne hither, in these words.
If God had knowne that the dead being raised might haue
profited the liuing, he would neuer haue let passe so great
a benefit, who otherwise doth giue and prouide vs al things
profitable.</p>

<p>Furthermore he addeth, that if it were requisite still to
raise vp dead men, to make relation vnto vs of such things
as there are done, this no doubt in continuaunce of time
would haue bene neglected: and so the Diuell very easily
would haue broached and brought in damnable opinions
into the world. For he might often haue made counterfeit
sightes, or suborne suche as should faine their selues to be
dead and buried, and by and by to present themselues before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
men, as if they had bin in d&eacute;ede raised from death, and by
suche manner of persons might so haue bewitched simple
soules, that they would bel&eacute;eue whatsoeuer he would haue.
For if now when there is ind&eacute;ed no such thing, the vaine
dreames as it were of men deceased, that haue bin shewed
to men in sl&eacute;epe, haue deceiued, peruerted &amp; distroied many:
surely much sooner would the same haue fallen out, if it had
bin a thing truly don, &amp; this opinion had preuailed in mens
heads. For if many dead persons had retourned backe again
into this life, the wicked spirit the diuell would easily
haue deuised many sleights and wiles, and brought in much
deceit into the life of man. And therfore God hath clean shut
vp this dore of deceit, and not permitted any dead man to returne
hither &amp; shew what things be don in y&#868; other life, least
the diuel might gr&eacute;edily catch this occasi&#333; to plant his fraudulent
policies. For when the prophets were, he raised vp
false prophets: when the Apostles were, he stirred vp false
Apostles: and when Christ apeared in flesh, he sent thither
false Christs or antechrists: And when sincere &amp; sound doctrine
was taught, he brought into the world corrupt &amp; damnable
opini&#333;s, sowing tares whersoeuer he came. And therfore
although it had come to passe, y&#868; dead m&#275; shold return again,
yet would he haue counterfeited y&#868; same also by his instruments,
by some fained raising of the dead through the
blinding and bewitching of mens eyes: or otherwise by subborning
of some which should feine themselues to be dead
(as I said before) he would haue turned all things topsituruie
and vtterly haue confounded them. But God who knoweth
all things, hath stopped his way, that he should not
thus deceiue vs, and of his great mercie towards vs, hath
not permitted that at any time any shuld return from th&#275;ce
and tel vnto m&#275; liuing, such things as there are don, hereby
to instruct vs that we should be of this opinion &amp; iudgment,
that the scriptures ought to be beleeued before other things
whatsoeuer, because that God in them hath most clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
taught vs the doctrine of the last resurrection. Further, by
them he hath conuerted the whole world, banished error,
brought in truth, and compassed all these things by vile and
base fishers, and finally in them hath giuen vs euery where
plentifull arguments of his diuine prouidence, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cyrillus.</div>

<p>S. <b>Cyril</b> in his 11. booke &amp;

saith: We ought to beleeue, that when y&#868; soules of holy men
are gone away from the bodies, they are commended vnto
the goodnesse of God, as into the handes of a most deare father,
and y&#877; they do not abide in y&#868; earth, as some of the Heathens
beleeued, vntill such time as they abhorred their graues:
neither that they are carried as the soules of wicked
men, vnto a place of exc&eacute;eding torment, which is hel, Christ
hauing first prepared this iourney for vs, but that they rather
mount vp aloft into their heauenly fathers hands, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FIrst our aduersaries do laie against vs, that by the vsuall
and common course of things, the soules of the godly
abide in heauen, and the soules of the wicked in hell, vntill
the last day, and do not walke at all: but yet that God
may dispence with them to appear here sometimes, therby
to instruct and admonish vs: And then <b>Samuel</b> did appeare
after his death vnto king <b>Saule</b>, and <b>Moses</b> also which forsooke
this life many yeres before: Likewise <b>Elias</b>, who was
taken vp in to heauen in a firie charet, appeared vnto Christ
our sauior &amp; his thr&eacute;e disciples, whom he tooke with him at
his transfiguration in the mount. <b>Lazarus</b> also of <b><i>Bethanie</i></b>,
returned from death into y&#868; earth, and many other also were
raised from death by Christ, his Apostles, and Prophets.</p>

<p>Farther they alledge this, y&#877; Christs Apostles bel&eacute;eued,
that y&#868; spirit or soule either of Christ, (as som of the fathers
vnderstand it) or of som other person did appear vnto them.
Besides to proue this matter, they alledge places out of the
fathers, decr&eacute;es of councels, &amp; the common report y&#877; hath bin
bruted of those y&#877; returned fr&#333; the dead. To al these reasons
by Gods assistance, we will briefly and orderly answere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soules do returne to instruct men contrary to
the common course of nature, by the omnipotent power of god.</div>

<p>As touching y&#868; first obiection, y&#877; al things are possible vnto
God, we deny it not. We graunt then, that God can bring
soules out of heauen or hel, and vse their trauell &amp; seruice to
instruct, comfort, admonish, &amp; rebuke men. But for y&#877; no text
or example is found in holy scripture, that euer any soule
came from y&#868; dead, which did so scoole &amp; warn men: or y&#877; the
faithfull learned or sought to vnderstand any thing of the
soules deceased, we cannot allow y&#868; sequele of their reason.
We may not of Gods almightie power inferre conclusions
to our pleasure. For this is a principle hold&#275; in schooles, y&#877; the
reason doth not truly folow, y&#877; is set from y&#868; power of doing,
to the d&eacute;ed done. For God doth nothing against himself, or
his word writen, to warr&#257;t their reson: they shuld first haue
proued, that it was gods wil, y&#877; soules shuld return into the
erth: for so do holy fathers intreat of gods almightie power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How we oght
to reason of
the omnipotent
power of
God.</div>

<p><b>Tertullian</b> against <b>Praxias</b> saith: Truly I neuer thought
that any thing was hard to bee done of God, we may faine
of God what we list, as if he had done the same, because he
is able to doo it. But we must not bel&eacute;eue that God hath
therefore done all things, because he is able to doo them.
But first wee ought to make enquirie whether hee hath
done them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambrose.</div>

<p>S. <b>Ambrose</b> in his sixt booke of epistles, and 37. epistle,
writeth vnto <b>Cromatius</b> in this wise: Therefore what is
there vnpossible vnto him? Not that thing which is harde
to his power, but that which is contrary to his nature. It
is vnpossible for him to lye, and this impossibilitie in him,
proc&eacute;edeth not of infirmitie, but of vertue and maiestie. For
truth receiueth no lye, neither doth the vertue of God entertaine
the vanitie of errour. Reade farther that which
followeth in the same place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hierome.</div>

<p><b>Hierome</b> writing to
<b>Eustochia</b>, of the preseruing of her
virginitie, saith: I will boldly auouch this one thing, that
though God can do all things, yet can he not restore a virgin
after her fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Augustine.</div>

<p><b>Augustine</b> in the tenth chapter
of his fifth booke <b><i>De ciuitate
dei</i></b> hath: That God is sayd to be omnipotent in dooing
that he will, and not in doing that he will not. Againe
he addeth: Gods power is not hereby any whit diminished,
when we say, that God cannot die or be deceiued. And immediately,
therefore he cannot doo some things because he
is omnipotent, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodoret.</div>

<p><b>Theodoret</b> also teacheth vs, that it may not absolutely
without exception be pronounced, that all things are possible
vnto God. For who so doth precisely affirme this,
dooth in effect say this much, that all things both good
and bad are possible vnto God, &amp;c. Wherefore f&eacute;eble is
that obiection of theirs: God can sende soules vnto men,
to teache and admonish them; therefore these spirites that
praye ayde, bee soules that come out of Heauen or Hell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">VVee must

<i>Deut.</i>18.</div>

<p>Heare what the Lorde our God in the 18. of <b>Deuteronomie</b>
speaketh: When thou shalt come into the lande
whiche the Lorde thy God giueth th&eacute;e, doo not thou learne
to doo after their abhominable rites, and vsages of those nations.
Let none bee founde among you, that maketh his
sonne or his daughter to passe through the fire: nor a diuiner
that doth foreshew things to come, nor a sorcerer, nor a
witche, nor a charmer, nor one that consulteth with spirits,
nor an inchanter, nor a Magitian, nor one that raiseth
vp the dead. For the Lorde doeth abhorre all that doo such
things: and because of these abhominations, the Lord thy
God hath cast them out before th&eacute;e. Be thou therfore sound
and perfect before the Lord thy God: and by and by he promiseth
to send them that great Prophet whom they should
heare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Esay</i> .8.</div>

<p>In the 8. of <b>Esay</b>, it is written: If they say vnto you,
enquire of them which haue a spirite of diuination, which
whisper and murmure softely in youre eares to deceiue
you. Should not euery people or nation enquire at their
God? what shall they go from the liuing to the dead? Let
them goe vnto the lawes testimonie, suche as haue no
light, should they not speake according to this word, which
who so should contemne, shall be hardened and hunger, &amp;c.
Heereby we doo vnderstand, that vnder a great penaltie
God hath precisely forbidden, that we shoulde learne and
searche out any thing of the dead. He alone woulde be taken
for our sufficient schoolemaister. In the Gospell we

<span class="sidenote"><i>Luke</i> .22.</span>

read: They haue <b>Moses</b> and the Prophets, let them heare
them. Vnto these may be added testimonies out of the Apostles
writings, that God doth not send vs soules hither

it pleaseth God to deale with vs, is his word. Therwithall

<h2>CHAP. VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>That the true Samuell did not appeare to the Witch in<br />
Endor.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_nl.png" alt="N" width="150" height="158" />

Ow touching y&#868; examples by them commonly
alleaged, which do think that the
souls of y&#868; dead do return again vnto the
liuing vp&#333; the earth: I wil first intreat
of <b>Samuels</b> apparition, of which matter
now adaies there is great contenti&#333; and
reasoning. And (as I trust) I shall proue
by strong arguments, that very <b>Samuell</b>
himself did not appeare in soule and bodie, neither that his
bodie was raised vp by the sorcerers, which perchance then
was rotten &amp; consumed vnto dust in the earth, neither y&#877; his
soule was called vp, but rather some diuellish spirit. First
the author of the two bookes of <b>Samuel</b>,
saith: that <b>Saule</b> did
aske counsell of the Lord, and that he would not answere
him, neither by Visions, nor by <b>Vrim</b>, nor by his Prophets.
Wherefore if God disdained by his Prophets yet liuing,
and other ordinary wayes to giue answer vnto him, whom
he had alreadie reiected, we may easily coniecture, that he
would much lesse haue raised a dead Prophet to make him
answere. And the rather, for that as we haue a little before
said, the lawe of God hath seuerely by a great threatening,
forbidden to learne ought of the dead, and would not haue
vs to searche for the trueth of them, nor that any man
vse diuination by Spirites, and suche other diuellishe
Artes. Secondly, if verie <b>Samuell</b> ind&eacute;ede appeared,
that muste of necessitie haue come to passe, either by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
will of God, or by the worke of arte Magike. But Gods
will was not that <b>Samuel</b> should retourne. For he hath
condemned Necromancie, and would not haue vs to aske
counsel at the dead: and that the spirit of God did that which
was contrary herevnto, or did permit the Saints to do it,
or was present with them that did ought contrary thereto,
it may not be graunted. And that those things were done
by the force and operation of Art Magike, w&eacute;e can not
affirme. For the wicked spirit hath no rule or power ouer
the soules of the faithfull to bring them out of their places
when he lust, sith they be in the hand of God, and the bosome
of <b>Abraham</b>, nay (which is lesse) he hath no power
ouer filthy and vncleane swine, for he was driuen (as we

<span class="sidenote"><i>Matth.</i>8.</span>

reade in the viii. chapter of Mathew) to beg leaue, before
he could enter into the heard of swine: and how then should
he haue any power ouer the soule of man? yet can it not be
denied, that God somtimes for certain causes doth giue the
Diuell and his seruants, Magitians &amp; Necromancers, power
to do many things, as to hurt and lame man and beast,
and to worke other straunge things. But that God dooth
giue the Diuell leaue to raise dead bodies, or to call, bring
foorth, or driue away soules especially out of Heauen, it
hath no grounde at all in Scripture, neither can there
be any reasonable cause alledged, wherefore God would
or should giue the Diuell licence to doo these things contrary
to the vsuall and common order, yea and againe
his owne expresse commaundement. For vayne and
childishe is the cause heereof that is giuen of some men,
that <b>Samuell</b> shoulde appeare to terrifie and astonishe
<b>Saule</b>: as if God coulde not haue feared him by other
waies and meanes. Was he not before vtterly abashed and
dismayed? Thirdly, if <b>Samuell</b> were brought backe, the
same was done either by his will and consent, or without
the same, but that he did fr&eacute;ely and of his owne accord obey
the sorcerers, no man I thinke is so blinde to imagine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>For that were vtterly repugnant to the Lawe of God, that
hee shoulde confirme Witchcraft and Sorcerie by his example.
If the Witch had called for <b>Samuell</b>, whilest he
liued, doubtlesse he would haue not approached vnto hir.
And how then can we bel&eacute;eue that he came to hir after his
death? We may not so say, that the Witch compelled him
to resort to hir against his will: for the Diuel hath no
power ouer the soules of the godly, and Magike of it selfe

<span class="sidenote">Wordes of th&#275;selues haue no force.</span>

is of no force. Heathenish superstition no doubt it is, that
wordes vttered by Magitians, after their peculiar manner,
or figures drawne, should haue suche a secret and hidden
operation. For the Heathens bel&eacute;eued that they could
with a certain set stile &amp; number of words, bring and draw
downe <b>Iupiter</b> out of Heauen.

<span class="sidenote">Iupiter Elicius.</span>

Wherfore they termed him <b>Iupiter Elicius</b>.
There are also certaine superstitious persons
in these our daies, which go about to cure diseases
by certaine rites of blessings, and by coniurings. Some
hang aboute their neckes certaine scrolles of Paper, in
which ther are written diuers strange words, but whether

<span class="sidenote">Plinie.</span>

wordes of themselues haue any force at all, reade <b>Plinie</b>
in his 28. booke, and 2. chapter, and <b>Cælius Rhodiginus</b> in
his 16. booke and 16. chapter of Antiquities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Apoc.</i>19.21.</div>

<p>Fourthely, if very <b>Samuel</b> himselfe had appeared, h&eacute;e
would not haue bene worshipped of <b>Saule</b>. For we reade
in the 19. and 22. chapter of the Reuelation, that <b>Iohn</b>
would haue worshipped the angell, whiche had opened
vnto him great misteries, but the Angell of God forbad
him so to do. Some h&eacute;ere aunswere, that <b>Saule</b> ment not
to giue vnto the Prophet, the honor that was due vnto
God, but onely a certeine outward and euill worship, such
as we are wont to y&eacute;elde vnto honest men, and suche as
haue well deserued of the Churche and common weale.
For they say, that the Hebrue word <b>Schachah</b> there vsed,
doth signifie to bend the kn&eacute;e, and to fall downe at a mans
feete: which kinde of worship we reade, that <b>Abigael</b> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<b>Nathan</b> the Prophet gaue vnto King
<b>Dauid</b>. And <b>Paule</b>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Rom.</i>12.</span>

also in the 12. Chapter of his Epistle to the Romanes
teacheth, that we should honour one another. <b>Thomas</b> of
<b>Aquine</b> intreating of those two places that I euen nowe
recited out of the Reuelation, saieth, that <b>Iohn</b> ment not
to worship the Angell, with the worship properly called
<b>Latria</b>, but with an other kind of worship termed <b>Dulia</b>,
that is to say, that <b>Iohns</b> will was not to withdrawe from
God, the honor due vnto him, but to worship the Angell
that was sent from God, only with a ciuill and outward homage:
and yet the Angell would not so far condiscend vnto

<span class="sidenote"><i>Actes</i>.12.</span>

him. In the new Testament the 10. chap. of the Acts of
the Apostles, we read that <b>Cornelius</b> met with
<b>Peter</b>, fell
downe at his f&eacute;et and worshipped him, yet, so as he had bene
an embassadour from God and not God himselfe, and yet
<b>Peter</b> lifted him vp &amp; said, Arise for I my selfe am a man also.
He said not to <b>Cornelius</b> thou doest well herein: nor as
his worthie Vicare (with a mischiefe) is wont to do, proffered
his foote vnto him to kisse. We may read also that <b>Elias</b>
disciples worshipped <b>Elizeus</b> that succ&eacute;eded into his office, to
which place the word to bowe the kn&eacute;e, or fall downe, is vsed.
But whether the Prophet did except and allowe this
kind of reuerence or no, there is no expresse mention. Br&eacute;efly,
it is not likely that the Prophet would haue suffered
the King to fall downe at his f&eacute;ete.</p>

<p>Fiftly, if he had bin the true <b>Samuel</b>, he would no doubt
haue exhorted <b>Saule</b> to repentance, and willed him to wait
for aide from God, to put his whole confidence in him, or
at least way, to haue giuen him some comforte, or counselled
him to fight againste his enimies with more courage.

<span class="sidenote">Testimonies out of the Fathers touching Samuels appearing.</span>

For though the Prophets do often chide and threaten men,
yet do they againe reuiue and solace them. Now because
this <b>Samuel</b> doth beate no other thing into his heade, but
that God was displeased with him, and had alredy forsaken
him, we may not bel&eacute;eue that he was the true, but a meere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote">Samuels appearing.</span>

counterfeit <b>Samuel</b>. Sixtly, the auncient Fathers write,
that the true <b>Samuel</b> was not s&eacute;ene.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tertullian.</span></p>

<p><b>Tertullian</b> in his booke <b><i>De anima</i></b> saith, that the Diuill
did there represent <b>Samuels</b> soule, God forbid (saith he)
that we should bel&eacute;eue that the diuel can drawe the soule
of any Saint, much lesse a Prophet, out of his proper
place, sith we are taught that Sathan dooth transfourme
himselfe into an Angel of light, and much sooner into a man
of light: who also will auouch himselfe to be God, and doo
notable signes and wonders to seduce, if it were possible,

<span class="sidenote">Augustine.</span>

the very elect. S. <b>Augustine</b> is not alwaies of one iudgement
touching this apparition: in his second booke to <b>Simplician</b>
Bishop of <b><i>Millaine</i></b>, and the third question thereof,
h&eacute;e graunteth that by the dispensation of Gods will, it
might so come to passe, that the spirite of some holy Prophet,
should consent to present it selfe in the sight of the
King, to come out of his owne place, and to speak with him,
but not to doo this by constrainte, or by the vertue of Arte
Magike, which might haue any power ouer it: but thereby
to shew it selfe obedient to the secret dispensation of God:
and yet he doth not dissemble, that a better answer may be
giuen, to witte, that the spirite of <b>Samuel</b> was not truly
and ind&eacute;ed raised vp from his rest, but rather some vain vision
and counterfeit illusion, that should be brought to passe
by the diuels practise, which the Scripture therefore doth
tearme by the name of <b>Samuel</b>, because the same is woont
to call the images and similitudes of things, by the names
of the things themselues. For who is he (saith <b>Augustine</b>)
that will be afraid to call a man painted, a man, considering
that without staggering, we are accustomed to giue eache
thing his proper name, assoone as we behold the picture of
the same: as when we take the viewe of a painted table,
or wall, we say straightway, this is <b>Tullie</b>,
this is <b>Salust</b>,
h&eacute;e <b>Achilles</b>, that other
<b>Hector</b>, this is the floud
called <b><i>Symois</i></b>, that place tearmed
<b><i>Rome</i></b>, whereof these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
things be ind&eacute;ede no other than painted Images, of those
things whose names they beare. Sith this is so, he saith, it
is not to be maruelled that scripture saith <b>Samuel</b> was seen,
when perchance <b>Samuels</b> image s&eacute;emed to appeare, through
the craftie pollicie of him, that transformed himselfe into
an Angell of light, and fashioneth his ministers like vnto
the Ministers of righteousnesse.</p>

<p>In his booke <b><i>De octo Dulcitij questionibus</i></b>, the 6. question
thereof, he vttereth all this in as many words, &amp; in his booke
<b><i>De cura pro mortuis gerenda</i></b>, he writeth that some are sent,
from the deade to the liuing: as on the other side, <b>Paule</b>
was rapt vp from the liuing vnto Paradice: h&eacute;e addeth
there the example of <b>Samuel</b> being dead, which did foreshewe
to <b>Saule</b>, things, that afterwardes should come to
passe. He saith further, that this place may otherwise be
vnderstanded, and that certaine faithful men haue bene of
this iudgement, that it was not <b>Samuel</b>, but that some
spirit fit for such wicked practises, had taken vpon him his
shape and similitude. And in other places, as we will shew
hereafter, he affirmeth, that there is a figure conteined
in those wordes, because the name of the thing is giuen
vnto the Image that dooth but represent the same: and
that it was not <b>Samuel</b> that appeared, but some diuellish
spirit.</p>

<p>Other Fathers of the Churche haue written nothing
particularly of this storie, so far as I know, but in certaine
places of their workes, they teache generally that good
spirites are not pulled backe into the earth by Magicall
Art. Of <b>Iustine</b> and <b>Gregorie</b> I will speake anone.

<span class="sidenote">The Popes decrees.</span>

In the very Papall decr&eacute;es, 26. question 5. chapter, <b><i>Nec mirum</i></b>,
it is written that it was not <b>Samuel</b>, but rather some
wicked spirite that appeared to <b>Saule</b>: And that it were a
great offence that a man should bel&eacute;eue the plaine words
of the storie without some farther meaning, for how saith
he could it come to passe, that a man from his byrth holie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and iust in conuersation of life, should by Art Magicke be
pulled out of his place? And if he were not so drawne against
his will, then he must n&eacute;edes agr&eacute;e thereto: both
whiche are like absurde, to bee imagined of a iust man.
This is the Diuels legerdimaine, to make shewe, as
though he had power ouer good men, thereby the rather to
deceiue many. He there farther addeth, that the Historiographers
doo set foorth both <b>Saules</b> minde,
and <b>Samuels</b> state,
and also those things which were sayd and s&eacute;ene, omitting
this, whether they were true or false. And other words followe,
whiche who so list to s&eacute;e more of that matter, may
there reade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lyra.</div>

<p>But here <b>Nicolas Lyras</b> iudgement (which in his Commentaries
on the bookes of the Kings, mainteineth the contrary
opinion) should bee little weighed and regarded of

is not written according to the censure of the Church,
though it be found in the Popes lawe, for otherwise saith
he, they which ensued in latter times, wold not haue written
contrary to y&#868; same, for many of those things concerning
which men haue written otherwise in latter times, were
neuerthelesse set foorth to the world, to be beleeued, as the
very expresse and sound iudgement of the whole Christian

<h2>CHAP. VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>A Confutation of their arguments, which would haue<br />
Samuel himselfe to appeare.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE will now come to the Confutati&#333; of their Arguments,
which maintaine, that very <b>Samuel</b> himselfe
appeared to the Sorcerers, for he that rightly
ouerthroweth his aduersaries arguments, is supposed by
the same meanes to confirme his owne cause. The ch&eacute;efest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
arguments which our aduersaries vse, is taken out of the

<span class="sidenote"><i>Eccle.</i>46.</span>

46. chapter of <b>Ecclesiasticus</b>, where these words are found.
<b>Samuel</b> before his death made protestation before God,
and before his annointed, that he tooke from no man his substance,
no not so much as the value of a shoe, and no man
could then reproue him. And after his death he prophesied,
and tolde the King of his ende. From the earth he lift vp
his voyce, and shewed that the wickednesse of the people
should perish.</p>

<p>This place somewhat troubled S. <b>Augustine</b>, and other
godly Fathers. For if the Diuell onely appeared, and
not <b>Samuel</b>, howe is it there saide that he slept, that is,
died, for the Diuel neyther sl&eacute;epeth nor dieth. Hereunto
I may shape this answere, that this booke is not to
be nombred among the Canonicall bookes of the olde Testament,
and that Doctrine in controuersies, cannot bee
proued by the authoritie thereof, the whiche Saint <b>Augustine</b>,
also confesseth in his booke <b><i>De cura pro mortuis
agenda</i></b>.</p>

<p>But howsoeuer that be credited as true or false, I answere
them plainly, that Iesus the Sonne of <b>Syraches</b> intent
was, to alleage the Storie literally, as the wordes
lye, and not by reason to debate the matter, whether <b>Samuel</b>
truly appeared or no. H&eacute;e speaketh there according to
the opinion of <b>Saule</b> and the Witche, which thought that
<b>Samuel</b> himselfe was raised. Further they say, that h&eacute;e
which appeared vnto <b>Saule</b>, is sometimes expresly and in
plaine words called <b>Samuel</b>. And an vns&eacute;emely matter it
were, making much for the reproach of so great a Prophet,
if his name had bene applied vnto the Diuel. If
say they, it had not bene <b>Samuel</b>, but some wicked spirite,
the scripture would in some one word or other, haue noted
the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>To this Argument first I aunswere, that euen in our
common sp&eacute;eche, it is an vsuall phrase by the figure <b><i>Metonymia</i></b>,
to terme the Image by the name of the thing, that
it presenteth. So we terme the Armes and Ensigne of a
Noble man, by the name of that Lord himselfe, that giueth
those Armes. We say, this is <b>Iulius Cæsar</b>, <b>Nero</b>,
Saint <b>Peter</b>,
Saint <b>Paule</b>, or here thou maist s&eacute;e
the Cities of <b><i>Tigurine</i></b>,
and <b><i>Argentorat</i></b>, also the Duke of
<b><i>Saringe</i></b>, whereas ind&eacute;ed
they are only their counterfeits, or Armes, and signes
of honour.</p>

<p>In a Comedie or Tragedie, we call this man <b>Saule</b>,
that <b>Samuel</b>, an other <b>Dauid</b>, whereas they do but betoken
and represent their personages. So saith <b>Virgil</b>, in his first
booke of <b>Æneidos</b>: They wonder at <b>Æneas</b> gifts, and haue
<b>Iulius</b> in admiration. And yet was it not <b>Iulius</b> or <b>Ascanius</b>,
but <b>Cupid</b> feining himselfe to be <b>Iulius</b>, whereby he might
the easiler pearce the heart of the ignorant Qu&eacute;ene, with
his dart of Loue.</p>

<p>Sainte <b>Augustine</b> in his seconde Booke and ninthe
chap. <b><i>De mirabilibus scripturæ</i></b> saieth, that holie Scripture
doeth sometimes applie the verie names of thinges to
the Images and similitudes of the same. H&eacute;e alleageth
there this example, that the foule spirit is called <b>Samuel</b>,
because h&eacute;e did falsely beare <b>Saule</b> in hande, that h&eacute;e
was <b>Samuell</b>: whiche fraude of the Diuell, coulde no
waies turne to <b>Samuels</b> reproach. For who would say, that
it should be a reproach for an honest man, if some knaue
would terme himselfe by his name, as if he were he himselfe.</p>

<p>The false prophets sayde, they were true Prophets,
and Gods servauntes, yea (which is more) they feined
themselues to be the verie <b>Messias</b>, the Sonne of God.
And that Scripture dooth not so muche as in one word
make mention, that this was verie <b>Samuell</b> in deede,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
but rather some spirite, we must thinke that it so came to
passe, for this cause, that all men by the Lawe of God
might vnderstand, that Magike and enquirie of things at
the dead, did much displease God. <b>Saule</b> himselfe before
by the counsell and motion of <b>Samuel</b>, slewe all the Magitians
that he could any where finde. And God is not accustomed
in this wise to interprete Figuratiue sp&eacute;eches:
for many of them are soone descried by such as giue diligent
h&eacute;ed to them. A vaine and superfluous sp&eacute;ech it were,
if a man woulde say that is <b>Peter</b>, this is the Image
of <b>Peter</b>, whiche by a Figure, is called by the name of
<b>Peter</b>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, holie Scripture dooth vse to speake of
things, rather according to the opinion and iudgement of
men, than according to the substaunce and true b&eacute;eing
which they haue ind&eacute;ede. So Iesus is called the Sonne
of <b>Ioseph</b>, and <b>Iosephe</b>
named his father, whereas notwithstanding,
our Sauiour Christ Iesus, was borne of a
chaste and vnspotted Virgine, without any helpe of man.
And yet neuerthelesse many of the Iewes, imagined, that

<span class="sidenote">1. <i>Cor.</i> 1.</span>

he was the Sonne of <b>Ioseph</b>. In the 1.
<b>Cor.</b> 1. the Gospel it
selfe is named foolishnesse, because that men did account the
great wisedome of God but as m&eacute;ere foolishnesse. So in the

<span class="sidenote">1. <i>Cor.</i> 10.</span>

first Epistle to the <b>Corinthians</b>, and tenth chapter, the scripture
tearmeth them gods, which be nothing lesse than so

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iere.</i> 10.</span>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Psal.</i> 96.</span>

ind&eacute;ed. And that for this cause onely, for that the Heathen
tooke them for gods, and so did worship them. Euen so the
scripture doeth tearme the Diuell <b>Samuel</b>, because <b>Saule</b>
thought him to be <b>Samuel</b> in very d&eacute;ed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VVhether the
diuel forknow
of thinges to
come.</div>

<p>An other reason they vse, that <b>Samuel</b> foreshewed vnto
<b>Saule</b> suche thinges as afterwardes should come to passe:
as that the Philistians should in battayle ouerthrowe his
Armie, and he and his sonnes togither be slaine. And all
these thinges came to passe according to his Prophesie.
And say they, the Diuel knoweth not, neither can he foretell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of things to come, sith it is onely in Gods power so to

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn</i> 8.</span>

doo: But as Christ in the eight of <b>Iohn</b> saith, he is a lyar,
and the father of lies. Hereunto a man may easily answere:
The Diuell knewe howe things stoode with the Iewes,
and the Philistines, he vnderstood euen the very secret consultations,
priuie practises, and warlike preparation on
both sides. He sawe that the Israelites were slenderly addressed
vnto battaile, and vtterly daunted of courage. Besides
this, <b>Samuel</b> had a little before threatned <b>Saule</b> with
Gods heauie wrath and vengeance, and that <b>Dauid</b> should
be aduaunced to the kingly throne, whereby he might easily
gather what would ensue, and that <b>Saule</b> must n&eacute;edes
giue place to <b>Dauid</b>. And if the euent had bene otherwise,
yet he knew that <b>Saule</b> with this prophesie would be quite
dismaied, and driuen to dispaire: which thing must n&eacute;edes
well content and please Sathan, who laieth his baites day
and night to intrappe men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Which being doubtfully spoken, may be vnderstood
either of subuerting other kingdomes, or loosing his owne.</div>

<p>The Diuell dooth not presently vnderstand things to
come, and therefore he giueth doubtfull answeres to such
as s&eacute;eke oracles of him: As when he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Cr&oelig;sus perdet Halin transgressus plurima regna</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, <b>Cresus</b> passing ouer the riuer, <b>Halis</b> shall ouerturne
many kingdomes. And yet oftentimes he gathereth
one thing no otherwise than by an other. Hereof writeth
<b>Augustine</b> in the 26. 27. 28. Chapters of his Booke <b><i>De
Anima</i></b>. The Diuel is one which hath bene long beaten in
experience, the which thing in all affaires and matters is
of very great force. For olde and practised souldiours doo
by and by fores&eacute;e to what issue things will come, but yoong
men, and such as want experience, doo not forthwith espie
out the euent of each enterprise. Moreouer, the Diuels
are very actiue, and can soone dispatch their matters. The
Marriners knowe when windes and stormes will arise.
Husbandmen also are not destitute of their prognostications.
The skilfull Astronomer can many yeares before exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
foretell when there will happen an Eclipse of the
Sunne and Moone. The Phisitian by the criticall dayes,
pulse, and vrine, can lightly iudge whether his patient shall
liue or no: builders s&eacute;e before hand when an house will fall,
and a practised souldioure can straightwayes iudge who
shall winne the victorie. And what maruaile then may it
be, if the Diuell an olde trained souldiour, can sometimes
foreshew some certain thing? Shall we be of this minde,
that so many yeares experience hath broughte them no
knowledge at all? Otherwhiles he telleth things which be
true ind&eacute;ed, and yet to no other end, but that he may thereby
purchase a certaine credite vnto his lying, to seduce the
ignorant.</p>

<p>For euen that counterfeit <b>Samuell</b>, made wise, as if
he had taken it in very ill part, that <b>Saule</b> did so molest
and disquiet him, and that he should be forced to talke with
him: he vseth farther the words as it were of <b>Samuel</b> himselfe.
And hereof it commeth, that many gather, he was the
true <b>Samuel</b> ind&eacute;ede. But what doth not Sathan deuise,
to deceiue men, and to force them vnto desperation? Here
I could alleage examples of suche as haue bin perswaded,
that they sawe and heard this and that man, and moreouer
knewe them perfectly by their speeche: whereas they
haue afterwards had euident intelligence, that they were
at that time many miles distant from them. So craftie is
the Diuell, and knoweth how to worke these and many
other feates.</p>

<p>There are farther, diuers places alleaged out of the
auncient Fathers, that s&eacute;eme to make for them, whiche
affirme that true <b>Samuell</b> appeared vnto <b>Saule</b>. But
these places w&eacute;e haue before for the moste parte aunsweared.
For albeit <b>Augustine</b> in some places mooue
a doubte, whether it were the true <b>Samuel</b> or no, yet
in certaine other places hee lyketh and beste alloweth
their opinion, who denie <b>Samuel</b> to haue appeared at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
all, taking rather that kinde of sp&eacute;ech, for tropicall and figuratiue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iustinus.</div>

<p><b>Iustine</b> the Martir, who is one of the most auncient
Fathers, reasoning against <b>Trypho</b> a Iewe, writeth in
his <b><i>Colloquio</i></b>, that the couetous Sorceresse at
<b>Saules</b> commaundement
raysed vp <b>Samuels</b> soule. And no man
shoulde maruaile h&eacute;ereat, sith that the selfesame Author
doeth by and by adde, that he is of this iudgement, that
all the soules of Prophettes and iust menne are subiect
vnto suche power as a man may in verie d&eacute;ed bel&eacute;eue,
to haue bene on this gr&eacute;edie and subtile Witche. But this
none of the Fathers will graunt him. Other Gr&eacute;eke writers
also, whiche in their tender yeares applied theyr
mindes to Philosophie, and not to the studie of holy
Scriptures, and afterwardes were conuerted to Christianitie,
doo sette foorthe in their writings certaine opinions
which are not agr&eacute;eable to the word of God. Wherefore
it n&eacute;ede not s&eacute;eme a straunge thing to any manne,
that <b>Iustine</b> the Martire in some pointes had his errors.</p>

<p>The same Authour in <b><i>Responsionibus ad Orthodoxos</i></b>,
question 52. mainteineth the contrary assertion. For, saith
he, whatsoeuer things were done by that hungry Witche,
were ind&eacute;ede the workes of the Diuell, who did so dazle
the eyes of such as beheld him, that it s&eacute;emed vnto them,
they sawe <b>Samuel</b> himselfe, when in verie d&eacute;ede h&eacute;e was
not there. But the truth of his words proc&eacute;eded from God,
who gaue the diuel power to appeare vnto the Sorceresse,
and to declare vnto her, that which should afterwards come
to passe. &amp;c.</p>

<p>If any man obiect that this woorke is not rightly
ascribed vnto <b>Iustine</b>, (for so muche as h&eacute;e doth make
mention of <b>Origen</b>, and <b>Ireneus</b>
the Martire, whereas notwithstanding hee him selfe was martyred before
them. And farther, speaketh of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<b>Manichees</b>,
who were in their ruffe long after this time. Hereunto we
answere, that if this booke were not written by <b>Iustine</b>, yet
(as may appeare) some other learned Clarke wrote that
worke, whose authoritie might carry away as great credit
as <b>Iustines</b>, sith that the same doth fully agr&eacute;e with holie
scripture. Furthermore we may set against <b>Iustine</b>, other
holy Fathers, as <b>Tertullian</b> and <b>Chrysostome</b>, of whom we
haue before spoken, who haue by holy scripture instructed
vs, that it was not <b>Samuell</b> ind&eacute;ede whiche appeared vnto

<span class="sidenote">Gregorius.</span>

<b>Saule</b>. We will hereafter say somewhat of <b>Gregorie</b>, who
no doubt was a learned and godly Father, but yet too simple
and light of bel&eacute;efe.</p>

<p>And the Fathers themselues deny, that a man should
subscribe vnto their opinion in ought that they doo maintaine
and auouche without the warrant of Gods word.
The Popes out of <b>Augustine</b> written in their Decr&eacute;es,
<b>Quest. 9. ca. Noli</b>, that a man should credit none of the Fathers
except he proued his saying out of holy Scriptures.
But in these dayes many cull nothing out of their bookes
but errours, and whatsoeuer they maintaine by good testimony
of the holy scriptures, that they reiect and disanull:
in which point they do fitly resemble those children, who
only in things wicked and euil, imitate their good parents:
for good men also haue their faultes.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Whether the Diuell haue power to appeare vnder the<br />
shape of a faithfull man?</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_bl.png" alt="B" width="150" height="155" />
Ut thou doest demand whether the Diuill
can represent the likenesse of some
faithfull man deceased? Hereof we n&eacute;ed

<span class="sidenote">2. <i>Cor.</i> 11.</span>

not doubt at all. For in the 2. <b>Cor.</b> 11.
S. <b>Paul</b> witnesseth, that sathan transformeth
himselfe into the shape &amp; fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of an Angell of light. Sathan by nature is a spirit, and is
therefore tearmed an Angel, because God vseth to send him
to bring that thing to passe which he thinketh best. So in

<span class="sidenote">2. <i>Reg.</i> 22.</span>

the second of <b>Kings</b> .22. Chapter, an euil angell was sent
foorth to <b>Ahabs</b> destruction, to be a lying spirit in the mouth
of 400. false prophets. This was an angell of errour and
darkenesse: who yet in outwarde shewe could resemble a
good Angell, that he might so guide the counsell of <b>Baalls</b>
worshippers, who no doubt vaunted themselues, as if they
had bene gathered togither by Gods holy spirit. If sathan
be then so skilfull, can he not counterfait and faine himselfe
to be some holy man, by resembling his words, voyce, iesture,
and such other things?</p>

<p>Amongst the Gentiles he hath done miraculous Actes,
perswading them to thinke, that soules by Arte Magicke
were called vp, and compelled to giue answere of secrete
and hidden things that were to come. And therefore not
only in publike, but also priuate affaires, if they s&eacute;emed to
be any thing hard vnto them, they consulted with Magitians
and Sorcerers, and had moreouer recourse sometimes
vnto Oracles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tertullian.</div>

<p><b>Tertullian</b> in his booke <b><i>De Anima</i></b> mentioneth, that
there were some euen in his dayes, which professed they
could raise vp and reclaime soules from the hellishe habitation.
And he calleth Arte Magike, the second Idolatrie,
in the whiche the diuels doo as well fayne themselues to
bee dead men, as they doo in the other to bee Gods. So doo
these subtle spirites lurke, and doo many straunge things
vnder the pretence of deade men. He addeth, that Magike
is thought to conuey soules out of Hell which lye there
in rest, and to represent them vnto our sighte, by reason
that it sheweth a vaine vision, and counterfeiteth the shape
of a bodie. Neither is it a harde matter for him to bleare
and beguile the outward eyes, who can easily darken and
dazell the inwarde sighte of the minde. The Serpents that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
were brought foorth by the inchaunters rods, s&eacute;emed to the
<b><i>Egiptians</i></b> to be bodies, but the truth of <b>Moises</b> deuoured
vp the Magitians lye. <b>Simon</b> also and <b>Elimas</b> the Magitians,
did many signes and wonders against the Apostles
&amp;c. H&eacute;e addeth, that euen in his time those heretikes named
properly Simonistes of <b>Simon</b> the Magitian, the first
author of that sect, did with suche greate presumption aduaunce
their arte, that they professed they coulde rayse from
the dead, euen the soules of the Prophets. &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lactantius.</div>

<p><b>Lactantius</b> in the .2. booke &amp; 17. chap. <b>De origine erroris</b>,
writeth, that euill angels lurking vnder the names of the
dead, did wound and hurt the liuing, that is, they tooke vnto
themselues the names of <b>Iupiter</b> and <b>Iuno</b>, whome the
heathens tooke to be gods, or as we now say, they tooke vnto
them the names of S. <b>Sebastian</b>, <b>Barbara</b>, and others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Idem.</div>

<p>In the 7. booke and 13. chap. he saith, that the Magitians
with certaine inchauntmentes did call soules out of hell.
But this may not so be vnderstood, that <b>Lactantius</b> was of
this iudgement, that they by their wicked arts did bring
the soules back again into their dead bodies: but that they
did so vaunt and boast that they had raised vp this and that
soule. He also confuteth the opinion of the Ethnikes, prouing
by the testimonie of the very Magitians, whom they
highly reuerenced, that the soule was immortall. These
men affirmed and taught, that they did call vp soules from
the dead, the which point, euen those of the Gentiles bel&eacute;eued,
who notwithstanding thought, that the soule did
straightway die with the bodie.</p>

<p><b>Iustine</b> the Martire, in the second Apologie which he
wrote in the defence of Christians, hath these wordes: I
will (saith he) say the truth: In times past wicked angels
through vain visions deceiued women, and children, and
with straunge and monstrous sightes made man afraide,
by whiche meanes they often wroong that oute of foolishe
and rude persons, which by reason they coulde neuer get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of them. And therefore not knowing that these were the
Diuels engines and policies tending to delude them, they
by one consent termed the workers of these slie conueyances,
by the name of Gods, assigning to eache of them their
proper names, as best pleased themselues. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Afterwardes in the same Apologie h&eacute;e exhorteth the
Heathens, that they would not deny mens soules after this
life to be endued with sense, but at the least way, would
giue credit to their owne Necromancers, who teach that
they call vp mens soules. Also let them bel&eacute;eue those y&#877; affirme
they haue bin vexed with spirits of dead men, which
persons the common people term furious &amp; frantike bodies.
In <b>Augustin</b> <b><i>De ciuitate dei</i></b>, many such things be c&#333;teined.</p>

<p>Now what dreadfull, strange, and maruellous ceremonies
they vsed when they went about by their Magicall
Artes to call vp the soules of the dead, a man may s&eacute;e in the
sixth booke of <b>Lucan</b> the Poet: where he setteth foorth how
<b>Erictho</b>, a famous Witche in <b><i>Thessaly</i></b>, reuiued and restored
a souldiour to life againe, who was lately slaine before.
Which act he did at the request of <b>Sextus Pompeius</b>, that
so he might by him learne what woulde be the issue of the
battaile fought at <b><i>Pharsalia</i></b>.</p>

<p>This kind of Magike they properly terme <b>Necromancie</b>,
or <b>Phycomancie</b>, which is wrought by raising vp the
spirits and soules of the dead. Of which there were diuerse
sorts. For sometime appeared vnto men the whole bodies
of the dead, but at an other time onely ghostes and spirits:
and often nothing was heard, sauing onely a certaine obscure
voyce.</p>

<p><b>Plutarch</b> in the life of <b>Cimon</b>, (as h&eacute;e is translated
by <b>Ioachimus Camerarius</b>, in the Preface on <b>Plutarches</b>
bookes, <b><i>De oraculis quæ defecerint</i></b>, &amp; <b><i>de conseruata figura,
Ei, Delphis</i></b>) writeth, that <b>Pausanias</b>, when he had taken
the Citie of <b><i>Bizance</i></b>, sent for <b>Cleonice</b>, a mayden of
noble parentage, to haue vnhonest company with her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Whom her parents partly by necessitie, and partly for fear,
sent vnto him. But after that the virgin had once obteined
so much of his waiters in his priuie Chamber, that they
should at her first entrance, put out the lightes, she in the
darke going softly towardes <b>Pausanias</b> bedde, by the way
stumbled on the candlesticke, and ouerthrew it against her
will, as he laie a sl&eacute;epe in his bedde, who being troubled
with the sodaine noyse, drew a swoord that laie by him, and
therewith slewe the virgine, as she had bene his enemie,
which went priuily to set vpon him. But she being thus
slaine with that deadly stroake, would neuer suffer <b>Pausanias</b>
to take his quiet rest, but in a vision appearing vnto
him in the night season, denounced sentence of hatred against
this noble captaine, in these words.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gktext">&Sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&#8150;&chi;&epsilon; &delta;&#7985;&chi;&epsilon;&sigmaf;

</p>

<p class="center">which is,<br />
</p>

<p>Answere to the lawe, for wrong is an euill thing vnto
all men. This heinous d&eacute;ede of <b>Pausanias</b> was verie gr&eacute;euously
taken of all his companions, who therefore vnder
the conduction of captaine <b>Cymo</b> sette on him, and chased
him out of <b><i>Thracia</i></b>. And thus hauing lost the Cities of <b><i>Bizance</i></b>,
when (as it is reported) the fight continued in troubling
him, he fledde vnto <b><i>Necyomantium</i></b>, at <b><i>Heraclea</i></b>,
where the soule of <b>Cleonices</b> being called vp, h&eacute;e by intreatie
pacified her displeasure. Sh&eacute;e did there both present
her selfe vnto his sight, and also told him, it should shortly
come to passe, that the euill towardes him should cease,
assoone as he came to <b><i>Sparta</i></b>. Hereby priuily intimating
his death, &amp;c. This <b>Pausanias</b> did at the first soberly and
discr&eacute;etely demeane himselfe, but afterwardes b&eacute;eing puffed
vp with such victories as he had obteined, he ruled and

<span class="sidenote">Ephori am&#333;gest the Lacedemonians were Magistrates, who
in certaine cases were aboue kings, vnto whom appeales were made from
kings: euen as amongst the Romans, they appealed from the Consuls to
the Tribunes.</span>

raigned lyke a verie Tyraunt. Wherefore when the
Magistrates called <b>Ephori</b>, would haue committed him to
prison, he tooke Sanctuarie in a Temple, where he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
shut vp vntill he famished through hunger.</p>

<p>I might here heape togither many such like Histories,
to proue euidently what this <b>Samuel</b> was. In other matters
also, if God licence him, the Diuel is not destitute of
power, and how craftie and readie he is for all assaies, experience
doth well declare.</p>

<p>Furthermore graunt that, wherin the pith and strength
of the question doth consist (which can neuer be proued by
scripture) that God did permit <b>Samuell</b> to returne and to
prophesie things to come after his death, yet will it not
thereof follow, that such visions should now be shewed also,
or that those things should be out of hand credited and
done which they commaund.</p>

<p>God in times past, did often in visible shape send his Angels
vnto men, but now we heare not that many are sent
vnto men, neither ind&eacute;ed is the same necessary. When the
Apostles liued here, many notable miracles were done, but
now for certaine good causes, they cease and fall away, for
whatsoeuer is necessary for our saluation, is expresly conteined
in the word of God. These notes touching <b>Samuels</b>
appearing, may suffise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mat.17.</i>
Moses &amp; Elias
appeared.</div>

<p>N like manner they obiect vnto vs, out of
the 17. of <b>Matthew</b>, that <b>Moses</b> and <b>Helias</b>
were s&eacute;ene in the Mount, (which is called
by the olde Writers <b><i>Tabor</i></b>,) with our
Lord Iesus, by the Apostles whom he had
chosen for the same purpose, and that they
did speake with him. <b>Luke</b> telleth of what matters they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
communed with him, to wit of his death, that is y&#868; death of
the crosse. Thereupon they gather, that the soules of dead
men may come againe into earth &amp; appeare vnto men: we
haue graunted before that God is able to send soules again
into the earth, but that it is his will so to do, or that it is necessary
especially at these dayes, is not yet proued. <b>Moses</b>
and <b>Helias</b> appeared appeared not to al the Apostles but only to thr&eacute;e,
neither did they speake to those thr&eacute;e, they brought no new
Doctrine, they commanded them not to build Churches in
their honor, or to do any such like thing, whether that their
soules came alone, or their bodies: also sure it is, they were
not sent to the Apostles, but to Christ onely.</p>

<p>It was very necessary, that they which should be Christs
witnesses, shuld very wel vnderstand, that both y&#868; Law and
the Prophets, do beare record vnto our Sauior Christ, that
he shuld die for the world, and come again in the latter day,
to raise vp the dead bodies, to glorifie them, &amp; to carry them
with him, into eternal blisse. And for this cause, God would
haue these two excellent Prophets s&eacute;ene of the Apostles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lazarus came againe on earth. <i>Iohn 11.</i></div>

<p><b>Lazarus</b> soule did not only appeare, but he came againe
both in bodie &amp; soule, as <b>Iohn</b> witnesseth in his 11. chap. he
is as it were a sure token, of our true resurrection, which
shall be in the last day, as also others, which our Sauiour
Christ, the Apostles, and in auncient time, the Prophets
haue raised from the dead. You shall neuer read that either
<b>Lazarus</b>, or any other haue tolde where they were while
they were dead, or what kind of being there is in the other
world, for these things are not to be learned and knowne
of the dead, but out of the word of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth.27.</i>
At the resurrecti&#333;
of christ
many rose againe.</div>

<p>The like may be said to that which is in the 27. chap. of
S. <b>Matthew</b>, that when Christ suffered on the Crosse, the
graues were opened, &amp; afterwards on the day of his resurrection,
many dead bodies did arise, &amp; appeared to many at
<b><i>Hierusalem</i></b>. The soules of the dead did not only appeare,
neither did they warne the liuing, or command them to doo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
this or that for y&#868; deads sake, to wit, either to pray for them,
or to go on pilgrimage to saints, &amp;c. But y&#868; dead with their
soules and bodies togither, came into the earth: for h&eacute;ereby
God would shewe, that he by his death hath ouercome and
destroyed death to the faithfull, and that at the last day their
soules and bodies shall be knit togither, and liue with God
for euer. Now what these holy men were that rose againe,
and whether they remained any time in this present life,
or died againe, or went with Christ into heauen, looke the

<span class="sidenote">Augustine.</span>

iudgement of <b>S. Augustine</b> in his 99. Epist. to <b>Euodius</b>, and
his 3. booke <b><i>De mirabilibus. cap.13.</i></b></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Spiridion raised his daughter.<br /> Ruffinus.</span></p>

<p>To these we may ioyne that which <b>Ruffinus</b> writeth in
his ecclesiastical history, 1. booke, 5. chap. and which <b>Socrates</b>
repeateth in his first booke &amp; 12. chap. touching <b>Spiridion</b> Bishop
of <b><i>Cyprus</i></b>. He had a daughter called <b>Irene</b>, with whome
a certaine friend of hers left gorgious apparrell, she being
more wary than n&eacute;eded, hid it in the ground, and within a
while died. Not long after c&#333;meth this man y&#877; owned the apparel,
&amp; hearing say y&#868; maiden was dead, goeth to her father
whom sometimes he accuseth, &amp; sometimes intreateth. The
old father supposing this mans losse to be his owne calamitie,
c&#333;meth to his daughters graue, &amp; there calleth vp&#333; god,
beseeching him y&#877; he wold shew him before y&#868; time, the resurrection
which is promised. And his hope was not in vaine,
for the virgin being reuiued, apeared to her father, &amp; shewed
the place wher she had hid the apparel, &amp; so departed again.</p>

<p>I wil not deny this thing to be true. For the like historie
hath <b>Augustine</b> in his 137. epist. A certain yong man which
had an euill name accused <b>Boniface</b>, <b>Augustines</b> priest, y&#877; he
inticed him to filthinesse. Now wh&#275; y&#868; matter could neither
be proued, nor disproued by sufficient reasons: both of them
were bid to go to the graue of one <b>Felix</b> a Martyr, that by a
miracle the truth might be known. They had not bin sent,
vnlesse before this time also some secrete matters had bene
knowne by this meanes: it may be wel answered, that they
were good, or rather euil angels which did appeare.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>Whether the holy Apostles thought they sawe a mans<br />
soule, when Christ sodeinly appeared vnto them after<br />
his Resurrection.</b></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Luke 24.</i></div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE reade in the 24. Chapter of Saint <b>Lukes</b> Gospell,
that two Disciples whiche returned from
<b><i>Emaus</i></b> to <b><i>Hierusalem</i></b>, told the Apostles, that they
had s&eacute;ene Christ aliue againe, and whiles they yet spake,
the Lorde stood in the midst of them, and saide vnto them,
Peace be vnto you: but they being amazed &amp; afraid, thought
they sawe a spirit. &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christs Disciples
supposed
they sawe a
ghost.</div>

<p>Out of this some go about to proue, that the Apostles
bel&eacute;eued that spirits or soules did walke and appeare vnto
men, and that they themselues did thinke they sawe the spirit
of Christ (as certaine of the old Writers do expound it)
or else some other mans spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Many kindes
of spirites.</div>

<p>This argument may be answered two wayes. First
if they thought they sawe a soule, they thought a misse.
But they were no lesse deceiued with the common sorte
now, that when they thought Christ would raise vp an outward
and earthly kingdome, in which they should be chiefe.
Secondly, it may be, that they supposed they sawe an euill
or good Angell, for there are more kindes of spirites than
one. There is a spirit that created all things, to wit, God
the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. Againe there
be spirits that be created, as good and euil Angels, as also
the soules of men, which either are in the bodie, or by death
seuered from the bodie, and abide either in euerlasting life,
or in eternall damnation. As touching the state of soules in
Purgatorie, where they are prepared to the heauenly
iourney, and of <b><i>Limbus puerorum</i></b>, there is nothing extant
in holy scripture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It is manifest in scripture, that God appeared vnto the
holy Patriarches, to the Prophets, to Kings and others, in
diuers visions and formes, and that he shewed himself vnto
them and spake with them. <b>Iacob</b> sawe a ladder reache
from the earth vp to heauen, and God leaning on it. <b>Isaias</b>
sawe the Lord sitting vpon an high throne. <b>Daniel</b> sawe
an olde man sitting, and his sonne comming vnto him and
receiuing all power of him.</p>

<p><b>Tertullian</b> and other holy Fathers do teach, that the son
of God, which at the appointed time should take vpon him
humaine flesh, did appear vnto the Patriarches in an angelicall
shape.</p>

<p>When <b>Iohn Baptist</b> did baptise our Sauiour in <b><i>Iordan</i></b>,
the holy Ghost was s&eacute;ene in the shape of a Doue. The holy
scriptures in many places do testifie, that good Angels haue
oftentimes appeared to Gods Ministers.</p>

<p>That euill spirits are often s&eacute;ene, and that at this day
they shewe themselues in diuers formes, to Inchaunters
and Coniurers, and to other men also, as wel godly as wicked,
both histories and daily experience doth witnesse.</p>

<p>Truly we reade not, that soules haue appeared on this
fashion. By these we may easily gather, that the Apostles,
when they thought they sawe a spirit, did not bel&eacute;eue they
sawe a soule. Could they not thinke I pray you, they sawe
an euill spirit? Or rather that they sawe a good spirit, or a
good Angel? For it may be shewed by many examples, that
euen the faithfull haue bene troubled, and feared at the appearing
of good Angels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dan.8.10.</i></div>

<p>In the eight and tenth Chapter of <b>Daniel</b>, we read that
the Prophet fel into a sicknesse at the sight of Angels. The
Virgin <b>Mary</b> her selfe was afraide when she sawe the Angell
<b>Gabriel</b>. So was <b>Zachary</b> the Priest, &amp; many others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Acts 12.</i></div>

<p>In the 12. of y&#868; Acts, we reade, that <b>Herode</b> killed <b>Iames</b>
the Apostle with the sword, and when he sawe that it pleased
the Iewes, h&eacute;e caught <b>Peter</b> also, and when h&eacute;e had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
put him in prison, h&eacute;e deliuered him to .16. Souldioures
to be kepte, entending after the feast of Passeouer to kill
him. But the Angell of the Lorde led S. <b>Peter</b> out of the
prison by night through the Souldiours watch, and sette
him in the right way to the house of <b>Mary</b>, the mother of
<b>Iohn</b>, whose surname was <b>Marke</b> (where many were gathered
togither and prayed.) And when he had knocked at
y&#868; entrie doore, a maid came forth to harken, named <b>Rhode</b>.
But when she knew <b>Peters</b> voice, she opened not the entrie
doore for gladness, but ran in and tolde howe <b>Peter</b>
stood before the entrie, but they said vnto hir thou art mad:
yet she affirmed constantly that it was so. Then said they
it is his Angell, but <b>Peter</b> continued knocking, and when
they had opened and saw him they were astonied. In like
maner, now also when the Apostles saw Christ, peraduenture
they thought they sawe a good Angel. For there are

<span class="sidenote"><i>Mat.18.</i></span>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Psal.19.</i></span>

Angels giuen of God vnto men to k&eacute;epe them. Of this
matter there is somwhat red in the .18. of S. Matthew, &amp; in
the 19. Psal. &amp; we will note somwhat more of it hereafter.</p>

<p>The Gentiles also bel&eacute;eued (as may bee gathered by
their writings) that euery man had a good &amp; an euil Angel,
and that the good Angel did stir men vp to vertue, &amp; defend
them, but that the euil Angell did hurt men wheresoeuer
he could, and did prouoke them to wickednesse.</p>

<p>If our Elders, when they haue s&eacute;ene or heard any thing
of one that hath bene trauelling or dead, did say it is his spirit,
it may be, they ment not his soule, but his Angel: for if
when as spirits were s&eacute;ene now in this place, and by and
by in an other place, they did thinke them to be soules (as
in these latter times all men haue bel&eacute;eued:) in this they
were deceiued, as they haue bene in many other things also,
for soules are by and by receiued, eyther into euerlasting
ioy, or into eternall damnation.</p>

<p>If the Preachers and Teachers had done their duties,
and had in this and other pointes of Christian Doctrine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
rightly instructed the people committed to their charge, or
at the least, if they had not forbidden them to reade the holy
scriptures, they would haue thought aright both of this, and
other things which at this day are in controuersie.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>Concerning the holy Fathers, Councels, Bishops, and common<br />
people, which say that soules do visibly appeare.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THe authoritie of the holie Fathers is obiected against

<span class="sidenote">Ambrose.</span>

<span class="sidenote">Augustine.</span>

<span class="sidenote">Gregorie.</span>

vs, as that which Saint <b>Ambrose</b> writeth of Saint
<b>Agnes</b>, and Saint <b>Augustine</b> of Saint <b>Felix</b>, of which
we haue spoken before. And that which <b>Abdias</b> hath in the
life of the Apostles, that <b>Thomas</b> appeared after his death
and preached. Saint <b>Gregorie</b> in his Dialogues, doth write
diuerse and wondrous things, among others he rehearseth
many examples of the dead which appeared, and desired
helpe of certaine Saintes, yea and of the Apostles
themselues, whiche haue visited some vppon their death
beddes, a little before they departed, and many other
suche lyke matters, which they that list may read themselues.
It is saide that <b>Hierome</b> appeared to Saint <b>Augustine</b>.
</p>

<p>I will not in this place accuse the holie Fathers of vanitie,
yet this we must note, they say not they haue bel&eacute;eued
that they whiche appeared, were the soules of dead

<span class="sidenote">Many things fabulous in Gregories Dialogues.</span>

men, but they spake after the common manner. As touching
S. <b>Gregories</b> Dialogues, I cannot hide, this (which
many haue noted before mee) that many things are conteined
in them that are nothing true, but altogither like old
wives tales. Not because the holie Father hath written
these things of malice, but for that he being too too credulous,
hath put many things into his bookes, rather vppon
other mens report, than that he himselfe knew them certainly
to be true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>At this day also there are many honest and godlie men
which haue this faulte, that they are too quicke of bel&eacute;efe,
and altogither ruled by others. They iudge other men by
themselues, they would be ashamed to reporte any thing
that were false, and thinke suche men in like manner to
be affectioned, which doe abuse their simplicitie and goodnesse.
Oftentimes these men, through their too muche
lightnesse of bel&eacute;efe, fall into great daungers.</p>

<p>Moreouer, in that age wherin <b>Gregorie</b> liued, men began
to attribute much to those apparances and visions.
And at that time the true and sincere Doctrine began
greatly to decay. Truly the time in which a man happens
to liue, is much to be regarded: he himselfe confessed that
his times was the latter times. Therefore the Scriptures
shoulde haue b&eacute;ene more diligently lent vnto, neither
should any thing haue bene retained that was not agr&eacute;eable
vnto them. Some going about to excuse him, for
that he hath stuffed his Dialogues ful of miracles and wonders,
say he did it to mollifie by those examples, the peruerse
and hard hearts of the <b>Longobardes</b>, to the end they
might embrace the true Religion, which they had so greeuously
persecuted. But that it is in no wise profitable to
make knowen the true faith, by these helpes which are nothing
else but vaine tales, euen <b>Viues</b> himselfe, in his first
booke <b><i>De tradendis disciplinis</i></b> doth acknowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Counsells approue
the appearing
of
Soules.</div>

<p>Some vrge vs with the authoritie of counsels, which
haue allowed certain apparances of soules, and haue suffered
some bookes, whiche are extant of such apparitions,
to be read for the edifying of the simple, and some againe
togither with their visions, they haue cleane reiected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Councels
may erre.</div>

<p>It is reported that the Counsell of <b><i>Constance</i></b>, hath allowed
this vision:</p>

<p>A certaine Deane when he had giuen ouer his Deanrie,
went into the Wildernesse to doe penaunce: after
his deathe he appeared to his Bishop, and tolde him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the same houre in which he departed this life, there died
thirtie thousand men, among whome only his soule and
S. Barnarde were made partakers of eternall saluation,
and thr&eacute;e went into Purgatorie, and all the rest into endlesse
damnation. &amp;c. They say that Councels &amp; the churche
cannot erre, because they are guided by the holy Ghost.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Matth.24.</i></span>

Also in the 24. of Matthew, the Lord doth say in the later
dayes there shalbe signes and wonders, that the very elect
if it were possible might be seduced, therefore they conclude
those things which Councels do saye of such apparitions,
are to be bel&eacute;eued. Christs words are not so to be vnderstood
that the chosen can neuer be broughte into errors (for the
contrary may be shewed by many examples) but that
they do not abide in erroure, albeit some do very hardly
get out of the same againe. Tell me, I pray you, who they
were that came togither in auncient Councels? were they
not holy fathers? It is manifest that in many points they
were at variaunce among themselues, and that they haue
shewed by their contrary writings: yea and many times
they are contrary to themselues, and therfore they haue not
alwaies thought aright. Sometime they send vs to the
word of God, as to the most certaine rule and leauell of
faith. There are examples inough, by which it may be
shewed, that the old Councelles haue erred in some of
their determinations. The Councell of <b>Ariminum</b> hath
allowed the Arrians doctrine. The second Ephesin councell
did subscribe to <b>Eutiches</b>. The Councell holden at
<b><i>Carthage</i></b>, which <b>Cipri&#257;</b> gathered, pronounced flatly against
the scriptures, &amp;c. What shall we say was done in latter
times? It is well inough knowen by histories who hath
resisted Councels, and ruled them, and what hath bene
chiefly handled in them for certaine hundred yeares: And
what for the most parte hath by and by followed after
them, euen cruel warres and bloudy slaughters. If nowe
those auncient Councels coulde erre, who will maruaile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that they which haue assembled since haue erred? But as
touching the apparitions, that I may (all other things omitted)
talke only of them, tell me I pray you who should
certifie the Councels, whether this or that vision were
true or false? Certainly no Councels can bring to passe
that the lyes which haue bene scattered abroade, shall now
begin to be true tales, although they of the Councel haue
saide they are true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popes haue
approued the
appearing of
soules.</div>

<p>It is euen as foolishe to say, the Pope (who wil be counted
aboue all Councels) hath confirmed this or that miracle
to be true, which they say was wrought in some one
monasterie or other. How can the bishop of <b>Rome</b> being so
far off, knowe any thing better than they which dwell in
the same places? If the bishop hauing no other assuraunce
than out of their words or writings, which perhaps go about
to erecte newe pilgrimages, and newe deuises to get
money, confirme once that this or that soule was s&eacute;ene, it
must straight way without any gaynsaying be bel&eacute;eued.
But if any other men who haue with diligence sought out
the truth of the matter, do testifie the contrary: al that they
say must not be regarded. Consider (I bes&eacute;eche you) of
this matter. Before, all haue doubted whether the thing
were so or no, but assoone as the Pope doth giue his verdicte,
or some Church man do in his dreame s&eacute;e it to be so,
it is a heynouse matter afterwards to doubt of it. O time!
O manners!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Many affirme
they haue seen
soules.</div>

<p>As touching other common and lay men as they terme
them, which say they haue s&eacute;ene one after his death, and
haue heard and knowne him, and haue spoken with him:
I easily graunt they haue s&eacute;ene and heard some thing, and
haue thought verily they were soules, and that they did
speake with them. But it followeth not therfore, that they
were soules ind&eacute;ede, much lesse that any dead man hath appeared
in bodie &amp; soule vnto them. For at doomes day only,
the soules shall returne to their bodies againe. Soules are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
spirits, but spirits are inuisible, wherefore they cannot so
be s&eacute;ene, vnlesse they take some outward shape vpon them.
But it can neuer be proued by the testimony of holy scripture,
that as good and euil Angels, so soules take som shapes
vpon them. Besides this, it is most true that oftentimes the
shapes and formes of them whose soules are not yet sundred
from their bodies by death (as when one lieth vpon his
death bed) are no lesse s&eacute;ene than theirs which are already
dead. Therfore it is not necessary that we bel&eacute;eue y&#868; ghostes
which are s&eacute;ene, to be soules. By these things you vnderstand
what is to be thought of the tale of <b>Platina</b>, <b>Nauclerus</b>,
and others, which write that a certaine Bishop sawe Pope
<b>Benedict</b> the eight (lately dead) in a solitary place sitting on
a blacke horse, and being demaunded why he was so carried
about with the blacke horse, he warned the Bishop that he
should distribute the money which was giuen to the vse of
the poore (but now wickedly kept to other purposes) vnto
those poore folkes to whom of right it belonged. Other tales
of like stampe are rife euery where.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>Whether soules do returne againe out of Purgatorie, and<br />
the place which they call <i>Limbus puerorum</i>.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THat soules, which are gone either to heauen or to hell,
returne not thence, nor appeare againe before the latter
day, perchaunce some men would easily graunt:
but they imagine there is a third place, (which is Purgatorie)
out of the which soules do returne vpon earth. For as
yet the last sentence hath not passed on them, and therfore as
yet they may be helped, and therfore also they do craue help,
and shewe themselues vnto men. But we haue proued before
at large, both out of the scriptures, and also out y&#868;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
writings of the auncient Fathers, that the soules of the faithfull
are saued, and that the soules of the vnbel&eacute;euers are
damned immediatly without delay, and therefore there is
no Purgatorie. Against this, they alledge sundrie arguments,
amongst the which this, albeit it be very common,
yet is it the ch&eacute;efest, when they say, that no man is saued
except he bee purged from all his sinnes, and that sinne
cleaueth vnto vs euen vnto the graue. If we say that
puritie and cleannesse consisteth not in our workes, or in
the paines which wee endure, but that God through faith
in his sonne Iesus Christ (who is our onely redemption,
iustification, satisfaction, and raunsome for our sinnes) dooth
iustifie vs: they straight aunswere, that our faith is vnperfect,
and that the moste godly men complaine when
they depart hence, of the weakenesse of their faith. And
therefore that God dooth not take vp suche kinde of men
straightwayes into heauen, nor yet because they are not
vtterly voyde of faith, thrust them presently downe into
hell. And therefore, that there is a middle place betw&eacute;ene
both, which is called Purgatorie, in which the soules are
purified from the imperfection whiche remained in them
at the time of their death, and out of the which they are deliuered
by the merits of the liuing, and by large pardons.
Is not this as much as to attribute that vnto our owne
paines and to externall fire, which ought only to be ascribed
vnto the death of Christ? Dooth not Christ teache vs,
that if at any time we f&eacute;ele any weaknesse of faith, we shuld
crie out with the Apostles, Lord increase our faith? Dooth
God disdaine to heare the prayers of his faithfull people
in the extremitie of death? Christ saith, he that is washed
hath no n&eacute;ede saue to washe his f&eacute;ete, but he is cleane euery
whitte: H&eacute;e will saue vs, not for the woorthinesse of
our faith, but by his m&eacute;ere grace onely. He dooth bestow
these things amongst vs, as if some riche man did fr&eacute;ely
giue meate and drinke vnto others, whereof some of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
receiueth it in woodden, some in earthen, and some in siluer
or golden vessels: or as if a Prince did distribute vnto
euery one a piece of golde, and some receiue it with a f&eacute;eble
hand, and some with a strong and lustie hand. He that
hath the [weake] hand, receiueth money as well as he that hath the
strong hande. Saint <b>Paule</b>
exhorteth the Thessalonians in his first Epistle and fourth Chapter,
<span class="sidenote">1. <i>Thess.</i> 4.</span>
that they mourne not for the dead as the Gentiles doo. If there had
bene a fire of Purgatorie, as they haue falsely imagined, he could
not haue bene angry with them, although they had taken their friendes
departure somewhat impatiently, &amp;c. Other arguments which are
brought for the confirmation of purgatorie, are of late so confuted by
many godly and learned men, that it is maruaile our aduersaries will so
often repeate them.</p>

<p>But before I leaue this matter, I will here insert this
historie following. A certaine Germain being accused by
the Inquisitours of heresie (as they terme it) that amongest
his companions he denied Purgatorie, contrarie to
the common consent of the Catholike Churche, made his
answeare thus: If our parish Priest (quoth he) whome
I credite very much, preach vnto vs true doctrine in the
Pulpet, either there is no Purgatorie at all, or else it is
cleane emptie. For h&eacute;e oftentimes saieth, that Turkes,
Iewes, heretikes, and wicked men, goe not into Purgatorie,
but straight into Hell fire, from whence they shall
neuer bee deliuered: Then that by Pardons whiche
are euery where solde for money, many soules are restored
to their first perfection. And moreouer, that the Masse
is of such force, that there is not one sung in all the world,
by whiche one soule at the least is not deliuered out of the
flames of Purgatorie. If these things (quoth he) be true,
(for I will not go about to refell that which maister Parson
hath saide) I will stande in this my opinion. For you
doo all complaine, that the nomber of the Catholikes is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
verie small, the greater part of men being diuided into sundry
sectes, and the multitude of Epicures daily increasing.
Then are all mens pursses many times drawne drie by
pardoners, which for mony sell their indulgences, that by
them the soules of men may bee deliuered out of the torments
of Purgatorie. Furthermore, there is no village but
there are a great many Masses sung in it, before any one
husbandman dieth. What followeth then, but that there is
either no Purgatorie, or one vtterly voyde and emptie?
When the Inquisitors (who knew very well that their
men commonly taught such doctrine) heard these things,
they were amazed, and taking aduise togither, they all berated
him for occupying his head about questions nothing
appertaining vnto him, which they commaunded him to
leaue vnto Diuines, and to follow his owne businesse.</p>

<p>There was in our Countrey an honest and sober man,
who before the light of the Gospell began to appeare, vsed

<span class="sidenote">Dilemma, is a kind of argument
or reasoning, which euery way c&#333;uinceth him
vnto whome it is spoken.</span>

this <b>Dilemma</b>: The Bishop of
<b><i>Rome</i></b> either hath authoritie
to bring soules out of the paines of Purgatorie, or else
he hath no authoritie: If he haue that power, and will not
vse it, except he receiue money, he cannot escape the fault
of crueltie and couetousnesse: But if h&eacute;e haue no such authoritie,
surely it is great villainie to robbe so many widowes
and fatherlesse children, and so arrogantly to boast
himselfe of authoritie whiche h&eacute;e hath not. And if there
bee no Purgatorie (as by the holy Scriptures it plainly
gathered there is not) surely then mennes soules can
neyther returne from thence, nor offer themselues to be
s&eacute;ene of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limbus puerorum.</div>

<p>Nowe as touching the fourth place, namely <b>Limbus
puerorum</b>, (in the which innocent children, as they call
them, are saide to be) Papistes themselues scant dare affirme,
that they returne againe and appeare vnto men, and
craue their helpe: for they teache, that if they depart without
baptisme, they shall neuer enioy the sight of God, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for that cause they may not be buried in the same Churchyard
with other Christians. Merciful God! how many godly
matrones hath this false deuise miserably vexed? I call
it a false deuise, for that they bring nothing out of the holie
scriptures whereby to proue this poynt of doctrine. The
scriptures do not attribute so much vnto external baptisme,
which is by water. Was the condition of infants better in
the olde Testament than in the new? You do not reade
that the olde Fathers, supposed that infants which died before
the eight day, and therfore were not circumcised, should
be separated from the sight of God for euer. <b>Dauid</b> the king
and prophet, said he should follow his sonne, whom God had
called out of this life before he was circumcised. But it
was not <b>Dauids</b> meaning that hee should goe into a place
where he should bee depriued of the sight of God for euer.
But it appertaineth not much vnto our purpose to dispute
any further hereof. Thus haue I now answered the cheefest
arguments of our aduersaries, whereby they would proue
the soules of good and euil men, to offer themselues to be
s&eacute;ene sometimes of them that liue, after their departure by
death from their bodies.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XIIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUt thou wilt say, I doo not yet clearely and plainly
vnderstand what manner of things those are, whereof
(as it is sayd before) Historiographers, holy Fathers,
and others, make mention: as that holie Apostles, Bishoppes,
Martyres, Confessours, Virgines, and manie
other which dyed long agoe, appeared vnto certaine
men lying at the poynt of death, gaue them warnyng,
aunsweared vnto certaine questions, commaunded them
to doe this or that thyng: and that some thing is s&eacute;ene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and heard at certeine times, whiche not only affirmeth it
selfe to be this or that soule, but also sheweth howe it may
be succoured, and afterwardes returning againe, giueth
great thankes vnto them of whome it hath receiued such a
benefite: that the husband being dead, came in the nighte
vnto his wife nowe a widowe, and that seldome times any
notable thing hathe happened, whiche was not foreshewed
vnto some man by certaine signes and tokens. You
wil say, I heare and vnderstand very wel that these things
are not mens soules, which continually remaine in their
appointed places, I pray you then what are they? To conclude
in fewe words, If it be not a vaine persuasion proc&eacute;eding
through weakenesse of the senses through feare,
or some suche like cause, or if it be not deceit of men, or
some naturall thing, wherof we haue spoken muche in the
firste part, it is either a good or euill Angell, or some other
forewarning sent by God, concerning the which we will
speake more orderly and fully hereafter. Our sauioure

<span class="sidenote">Angells appeare.</span>

witnesseth in the Gospell, that children haue their good Angells:

<span class="sidenote"><i>Matth.</i>18.</span>

and we reade in the 18. of Matthew, that the Lorde
saide: Take h&eacute;ede ye contemne not one of these litle ones:
for I saye vnto you, that their Angels in Heauen do alwayes
behold the face of my father whiche is in Heauen.
Which words are not so to be taken, as though they were
neuer sent downe into the earth, but the Lord here speaketh
after the manner of men. For as seruaunts stande
before their maisters to fulfill their commaundement, euen

<span class="sidenote"><i>Esay</i>.63.</span>

so are the Angels prest and ready to serue God. <b>Esay</b>
the 63. The Angell of his face, that is, which standeth
ready in his sight, preserued them. And further they which
often stand in presence of their Lorde, are acceptable vnto
them and priuy to their secrets. Out of this place of Math.
Saincte <b>Herome</b> in his commentaries, and other fathers
do conclude, that God doth assigne vnto euery soule assoone
as he createth him his peculiar Angell, which taketh care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of him. But whether that euerie one of the elect haue his
proper Angell, or many Angels be appointed vnto him, it
is not expresly set foorth, yet this is most sure and certaine,
that God hath giuen his Angels in charge to haue regarde

<span class="sidenote"><i>Dani.</i>10.</span>

and care ouer vs. <b>Daniel</b> witnesseth in his tenth Chapter,
that Angels haue also charge of kingdomes, by whom God
k&eacute;epeth and protecteth them, and hindreth the wicked counsels
of the diuell. It may be proued by many places of scripture,
that all Christian men haue not only one Angell, but

<span class="sidenote"><i>Psal.</i>34.</span>

also many, whome God imployeth to their seruice. In the
34. Psalme it is sayd, the Angell of the Lord pitcheth his
tentes round about them which feare the Lord, and helpeth
them: which ought not to bee doubted but that it is also at
this day, albeit we s&eacute;e them not. We reade that they appearing
in sundry shapes, haue admonished men, haue comforted
them, defended them, deliuered them from daunger, and
also punished the wicked. Touching this matter, there are
plentifull examples, which are not n&eacute;edfull to be repeated
in this place. Sometimes they haue either appeared in
sl&eacute;epe, or in maner of visions, and sometimes they haue performed
their office, by some internall operations: as when
a mans minde foresheweth him, that a thing shall so happen,
and after it happeneth so ind&eacute;ed, which thing I suppose
is done by God, through the ministrie of Angels. Angels
for the most part take vpon them the shapes of men, wherein
they appeare. And so it may be, that S. <b>Felix</b>, and Saint
<b>Agnes</b>, and other which haue appeared vnto honest and godly
men, were the Angels of God. Angels haue appeared

<span class="sidenote">Whole armies of Angels.</span>

not only one at a time, but also whole Armies and Hostes,
of them, as vnto <b>Iacob</b> the patriarch, and <b>Heliseus</b> the Prophet.
It is read in the Ecclesiasticall history written by <b>Socrates</b>
and <b>Sozomenus</b>, that <b>Archadius</b> the Emperour receiued
<b>Gaina</b>, with all his Armie of souldiers, into the Citie
of <b><i>Constantinople</i></b>, to defend it, but this traitor went about
to get the rule of the Citie into his owne hands, and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he sent a band of men to fire the Emperours Pallace,
which sodeinly espied a great hoste of Angels, of large stature,
armed like vnto souldiers, whereupon they gaue ouer
their enterprise of fiering. Then sent he others who reported

<span class="sidenote">C&#333;stantinople preserued by
the appearing of Angels.</span>

the very same: At the last he went himselfe, and sawe
it to be so, and so left his purpose: and thus God by a miraculous
meanes, preserued the Cittie and Church of <b><i>Constantinople</i></b>
from the craftie subtiltie of the tyrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Augustine.</div>

<p>Whereas S. <b>Augustine</b> in his booke <b><i>De cura pro mortuis
agenda</i></b>, Chapter 10. writeth, that dead men, haue appeared
vnto the liuing in dreames, or any other meanes
whatsoeuer, shewing them where their bodies laie vnburied,
and requiring them to burie them. There he supposeth,
that these are the workes of Angels by the dispensation
of Gods prouidence, vsing vnto good purpose, both good
and euil Angels, according to the vnsearchable depth of his
iudgements. He saith not that such soules appeare in sl&eacute;epe,
but the similitude of soules. He addeth further, if the soules
of the dead had any thing to do with matters of the liuing,
and that we might talke with them as often as we list in
our sl&eacute;epe, his mother no night would leaue him, who to
liue with him, followed him both by sea and by lande, suche
loue bare she towards her sonne.</p>

<p class="center"><b>That sometimes, yea and for the most part, euill Angels<br />
do appeare.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">COntrariwise, euill angels are hurtfull and enemies
vnto men, they followe them euery where, to the
ende they may withdrawe them from true worshipping
of God, and from faith in his onely sonne Iesu
Christ, vnto sundry other things. These appeare in diuers
<span class="sidenote">Paule.</span>
shapes: for in the diuell (as <b>Paule</b> doth witnesse) transformeth
himselfe into an Angell of light, no lesse may he take
the shape of a Prophet, an Apostle, Euangelist, Bishop, and
Martyr, and appeare in their likenesse: or to bewitch vs,
that we verily suppose we heare or s&eacute;e them in very d&eacute;ede.
He taketh on him to tell of thinges to come, whether h&eacute;e
hit them right or wrong. H&eacute;e affirmeth that h&eacute;e is this
or that soule, that he may bee deliuered by this or that
meanes, that by these meanes he may purchase credite
and authoritie, vnto those things which haue no ground
of scripture.</p>

<p>By meanes of false myracles, he decreeth new Hollydayes,
Pilgrimages, Chappels, and Aultars: by Coniurations,
blessings, enchauntments, he attempteth to cure
the sicke, to make his doings haue authoritie.</p>

<p>You shall reade maruellous straunge things in <b>Arnobius</b>,
<b>Lactantius</b>, and other holie Fathers, who wrote against
the Gentiles and their superstition, after what
sorte Diuels haue deluded the miserable Gentiles, and
haue entrapped them in many errors. He ioyned and hid
himselfe in their Idolles, he spake through them from
one place to an other, he made them to moue, and did such
straunge myracles, that verie lame men leauing their
stilts whereon they leaned in the Temples of their Idols,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
returned home to their houses, without any helpe or stay of
them, but especially in the temple of <b>Æsculapius</b> (who was
counted the Patron of Phisicke) many of these kinde of miracles
are reported to haue happened. Wherefore there is
no cause, why the Papistes at this day, shoulde so insolently
glorie of the like myracles, by the which they goe
about to proue their intercession of Saints, and such lyke
trumperie.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Of wondrous Monsters, and such like.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_nl.png" alt="N" width="150" height="158" />
Owe as concerning other straunge
things, we must hereafter search what
nature they are of: as when one dieth
that there is somewhat s&eacute;ene, or some
great noyse is sodeinly heard, but especially
that many signes and wonders
happen before the death of great Princes.
It is well knowne by Histories,
what signes went before the death of <b>Iulius Cæsar</b>, amongst
the which, a great noyse was heard in the night time, in very
many places farre and neare.</p>

<p>As concerning other Emperors, and Kings, and other
great mens deathes, we reade that some certaine forewarnings
were heard or s&eacute;ene, we must also consider what those
straunge things are, which for the most part happen before
the innouations of kingdomes, before battailes, seditions,
and subuersions of Cities.</p>

<p>I say flatly, euen as I sayde before concerning spirits:
if they be not vaine perswasions, or naturall things, then
are they forewarnings of God, which are sent, eyther by
good Angels, or by some other meanes vnknowne vnto
vs, that we might vnderstand that all these things happen
not by aduenture, without the wil and pleasure of God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
but that life and deathe, peace and warre, the alteration
of Religion, the exchaunge of Empires, and of other
things, are in his power, that we might thereby learne
to feare him, and to call vppon his name. In the meane
season, Sathan also fayneth and worketh many things to
terrifie men, and to plant superstition in their hearts. But
that all things are done by Sathan, hereby we may vnderstand:
It chaunceth that one is thrust thorow and slaine by
one with whome he neuer was at variance, but hath euer
vsed him as his friende, some man is drowned, or falleth
from some high place, or otherwise is miserably slaine, an
euill spirit can haue no foreknowledge hereof (for there are
no naturall signes, or coniectures going before them, as
there are in diseases) yet notwithstanding, some signes and
rare casualties fall out before. Hereof do I gather, that
these things are wrought by God, who onely knoweth that
they shall come to passe, and they are not onely admonishments
vnto them, whom they especially concerne, but also
vnto them which heare them, and are present at the doing
of them.</p>

<p>There was a certaine Magistrate within the liberties
of <b><i>Tigurine</i></b>, not long before I wrote this, whome certaine
of his friendes tarried for to breake their fast with him before
h&eacute;e tooke his iourney, and thus waiting, they supposed
they heard a knife falling from the vpper part, or flore of the
stewe, wherein they were, yet sawe they nothing, and sodeinly
as they communed togither of this straunge wonder,
they thought they heard it againe. In the meane while
commeth the Magistrate, vnto whome they declare what
had happened, and as they had scant ended their talke, the
knife fell againe the third time, in the hearing of the Magistrate,
who before doubted very much of the matter. And
therefore taking occasion hereby, he began to exhort them,
that whereas within fewe dayes after, a great marriage
should be kept in the same place, they should all endeuour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to maintaine peace, and obserue sobrietie, least perchaunce
through quarrelling and murther, it should bee a bloudie
marriage. After he taking his iourney, and within a day or
twaine dispatching his businesse, as he was returning towards
his Castle, (his horse falling into a riuer, whiche
was sodeinly encreased with raine) after he had long striued
with the water, at the last died miserably.</p>

<p>And that the diuell doth delude men with straunge
happes, hereof I gather, that if any be taken with gr&eacute;euous
sicknesse, so that not onely the Phisitian, but also the sicke
themselues dispaire of their owne health, in the night time
there is heard a noyse as if one were making a coffin or
chest to laie one in, or were burying a dead bodie: that suppose
I to be an illusion of the diuil, for he thinketh verily
the diseased will die, whom God by meanes of godly and
earnest praiers, doth restore againe to his former health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plinie.</div>

<p>Where <b>Plinie</b> writeth that rauens are of such sharp
senses, that they will flie thr&eacute;e or foure dayes before, vnto
the place where carryon will afterwardes be, it is altogither
vaine and fabulous. If this were graunted, it were no
absurditie to say, that the diuell hath a knowledge of things
to come, yea euen where there are no naturall causes, &amp;c.
Moreouer he may by Gods permission, if warres and mutinies
be towards, stirre the instruments of warre, and all
other kinde of munition as it lyeth in the Armorie, he can
make a noyse and reare a clamour and crie, as it were of a
great Armie in the aire, and play as it were on a Drum,
and do other such things, which all Historiographers affirme
with one voyce, haue oftentimes chaunced.</p>

<p class="center"><b>That it is no hard thing for the Diuell to appeare in diuers<br />
shapes, and to bring to passe straunge things.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_bl.png" alt="B" width="150" height="155" />

Ut it is no difficult matter for the Diuel
to appeare in diuers shapes, not only
of those which are aliue, but also of
dead men, (whereof I spake also before,
when I entreated of Samuels appearing)
yea, and (which is a lesse matter)
in the fourme of beasts and birds, &amp;c. as
to appeare in the likenesse of a blacke
Dog, a Horse, an Owle, and also to bring incredible things
to passe, it is a thing most manifest: for hee may through
long and great experience, vnderstand the effects and force
of naturall things, as of hearbes, stones, &amp;c. and by meanes
hereof worke maruellous matters. And then he is a subtile
and quicke spirite, which can readily take things in hand,
which in each thing is of no small weight. By his quicknesse,
and by his knowledge in naturall things, he may easily
deceiue the eye sight, and other senses of man, and hide
those things which are before our face, and conuey other
things into their places. Whereof the holy scriptures, and
histories, and continuall experience beareth record. How
did the wicked spirit handle <b>Iob</b>? what did he not bring to
passe in short space? What straunge workes of an euil spirit
did <b>Bileam</b> bring to passe? did he not purchase a famous
name by his Magicall Artes? what wonderfull great miracles
did <b>Pharaos</b> Sorcerers? Did not <b>Simon Magus</b> so
bewitch the <b><i>Samaritanes</i></b> with his vnlawfull Artes, that he
would say he was the great vertue of God? Touching this
Coniurer, the olde Fathers write many things, as <b>Ireneus</b>
in his first booke and tenth Chapter, <b>Eusebius</b> in his second
booke and thirt&eacute;enth Chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Egesippus</b> writeth in his third booke and second Chapter,
of the destruction of <b><i>Hierusalem</i></b>, that this <b>Symon</b> came to
<b><i>Rome</i></b>, and there set himselfe against <b>Peter</b>, boasting that
he could flie vp into heauen, and that he came at the day appointed
vnto the Mount <b><i>Capitoline</i></b> where leaping from
the rocke, he flew a good while not without the great admiration
of the people, who now began to credit his words,
but sodeinly he fell downe and brake his leg, and after being
carried vnto <b><i>Aritia</i></b>, there died.</p>

<p><b>Iohannes Tritenhemius</b>, Abbot of <b><i>Spanheimium</i></b>, writeth
in his Chronicles concerning the Monasterie of <b><i>Hirsgraue</i></b>>
of the order of S. <b>Bennet</b>, in the yeare of our Lorde 970,
that <b>Peter</b> and <b>Baianus</b>,
the two sonnes of one <b>Simon</b> a
Monke, ruled ouer the <b><i>Bulgarians</i></b>, wherof the one, namely
<b>Baianus</b>, was throughly s&eacute;ene in the Arte of Necromancie,
and thereby wrought many myracles. He chaunged
himselfe into a Wolfe so often as he list, or into the likenesse
of an another beast, or in such sort as he could not be discerned
of any man, and many other straunge things h&eacute;e
could doo, and did, whereby he brought men into great admiration.</p>

<p>And after in the yeare 876. he writeth, that there was
a certaine Iewe named <b>Sedechias</b>, sometimes Philosopher
and Phisitian vnto <b>Lewes</b> the Emperour, who being very
cunning in sorcerie, did straunge miracles and wonderfull
sleights before the Princes, and before all other men. For
he brought it to passe by his cunning, that he s&eacute;emed to deuoure
an armed man with his horse, and all his harnesse,
and also a carte loaden with hay, togither with the horse
and carter. He cut off mens heads, their hands and f&eacute;ete,
which he set in a basen before all the lookers on to behold,
with the bloud running about the basen: which by and by
he would put againe vppon the places whence they s&eacute;emed
to haue bene cut off, without any hurt to the parties. He
was s&eacute;ene and hearde of all men to exercise hunting and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
running, and suche like things in the aire and cloudes, as
men are accustomed to exercise vpon the earth. He practised
so many and diuers deceites, that all men maruelled
and were astonished out of measure.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord .1323. when <b>Frederike</b> Duke of
<b><i>Austrich</i></b>, who was chosen Emperour against <b>Lewes</b>, as the
same author witnesseth, was vanquished in a great battail
betw&eacute;ene <b><i>Ottinga</i></b> and <b><i>Molndorfus</i></b>, and deliuered into the
hands of <b>Lewes</b>, who sent him away into a strong castell
to be safely kepte: It chaunced shortly after, that a coniurer
going vnto his brother <b>Lupoldus</b> in <b><i>Auctriche</i></b>, promised,
that by the helpe of a spirit, he would within the
compasse of an houre, deliuer <b>Frederike</b> safe and sounde
out of captiuitie, if he would promise him and giue him a
worthie reward for his paines. The Duke aunsweared
him: if thou wilt (quoth he) do as thou makest promise, I
wil worthily reward th&eacute;e. So the Magitian with the Duke
entring his circle of coniuration in an houre moste conuenient,
calleth the Spirit whiche was accustomed to obey
his commaundement. Whome, when he appeared in the
likenesse of a man, he commaunded by the vertue of his
coniurations, that he should sp&eacute;edily bring vnto him into
<b><i>Austriche</i></b>, Duke <b>Frederike</b>, deliuered safely out of prison.
Vnto whome the spirit aunswering, said, If the captiue
Duke will come with me, I will willingly obey thy commaundement.
This saide, the spirite flieth awaye into
<b><i>Banarie</i></b>, and taking vppon him the forme of a Pilgrime,
he entreth into the prison where the Duke was kepte prisoner:
whome assoone as he sawe, the Spirit whiche
was sente as messenger vnto him, said: If thou wilt be
deliuered out of captiuitie, mount th&eacute;e vp vpon this horse,
and I will bring th&eacute;e safe and sounde without any hurte
into <b><i>Auctrich</i></b> vnto Duke <b>Lupoldus</b> thy brother. Vnto
whome the Duke saide: Who art thou? The Spirite
aunswered: Aske not who I am, because it appertaineth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
nothing to the purpose, but get th&eacute;e vp on the horse which I
offer th&eacute;e, and I will bring th&eacute;e safe and sound, and fr&eacute;ely deliuered
into <b><i>Austrich</i></b>. Which when the Duke heard, h&eacute;e
was taken with a certaine horror, and feare, being otherwise
a hardy knight: and when he had blessed himself with
the signe of the holy crosse, the spirite sodainly vanished away
with the blacke horse, which he had proffered him, and
returned emptie againe vnto him that sent him: of whom
being rebuked because he had not brought the prisoner, he
declared all the matter vnto him in order. Duke <b>Frederick</b>
at the last being deliuered out of prison, confessed that it had
so happened vnto him in his captiuitie the very same day
they named. This historie is also to be s&eacute;ene in the Chronicles
of the <b><i>Heluetians</i></b>.</p>

<p>There are also Coniurers found euen at this day, who
bragge of themselues that they can so by inchauntments
saddle an horse, that in a fewe houres they wil dispatch a very
long iourney. God at the last wil chasten these men with
deserued punishment. What straunge things are reported
of one <b>Faustus</b> a Germane, which he did in these our dayes
by inchauntments?</p>

<p>I will speake nothing at this time, of those old Sorcerers,
<b>Apollonius</b>, and others, of whom the histories report
straunge and incredible things. Hags, Witches, and Inchaunters,
are said to hurt men and cattell, if they doo but
touch them or stroake them, they do horrible things wherof
there are whole bookes extant. Iuglers and Tumblers, by
nimblenesse do many things, they will bid one eate meate,
which when they spit out againe, they cast forth ordure
and such like. Magitians, Iuglers, Inchanters, and Necromanciers,
are no other than seruants of the Diuel: do you
not thinke their maister reserueth some cunning vnto him
selfe?</p>

<p>Howbeit this is not to be dissembled, that the diuel doth
glory of many things which ind&eacute;ede he cannot performe:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as that he saith, that he raised the dead out of their graues.
&amp;c. He may in very d&eacute;ede by Gods sufferaunce, shewe the
shapes of them vnto men, but he hath no such power ouer
the dead bodies.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Diuels doo sometimes bid men doo those things which<br />
are good, and auoide things that are euill: sometimes<br />
they tell truth, and for what cause.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_isl.png" alt="I" width="150" height="162" />
F those spirites which s&eacute;eke helpe at mens
hands be not soules, but Diuels, many will
say, why then do they perswade men vnto
good things, exhort them vnto vertue, and
call them from vice. For they say, Iudge vprightly,
take h&eacute;ede of theft and extortion,
restore goods vniustly gotten vnto their owners,
beware of periurie, surfets, and drunkennesse, enuie
and hatred, lying and deceit, pray earnestly, come to church
often, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Diuell is not pleased when w&eacute;e doo good, and auoide
euill: nothing woulde gr&eacute;eue him more, than that
we should liue accordyng to the prescript worde of God.
Therefore they are not Diuels which bid vs doo good, and
eschue euil.</p>

<p>Moreouer, those Spirites speake truthe, but the Diuell
is a lyer, and is called by Christe, the father of
lyes. Therefore w&eacute;e may not say that they are diuellish
Spirits.</p>

<p>Vnto this argument I aunswere thus: h&eacute;e dooth this
for his owne aduantage. If he should shewe himselfe so,
as he is by nature, he should little profit. That whiche
he doth, he doth it to this ende, that he may purchase credite
vnto his words, and that he might the better thrust other
things vpon men, and bring and driue them into sundry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
errours, whereby they forsaking the worde of God
might giue care vnto Spirites. Did not the seruaunts of
vncleane Spirits, I meane false Prophets, come in times
past vnder sh&eacute;epes skinnes, and fayned themselues to tender
the peoples commoditie, whereas in very d&eacute;ed in the
meane space they sought after another thing, that is, that
when they had obteined great authoritie, they might pill
and poule other men, and fill their owne bags with golde
and siluer? Do not all heretickes yet at this day say, they
are sent from God, and that we must eschue wickednesse,
and s&eacute;eke after vertue? Didst thou neuer heare that th&eacute;eues
trauelling by the way with those on whose company they
light, haue talked of liuing honestly, and of the punishment
of wicked men, and the rewarde of good men, to the ende
that after they might take y&#868; aduantage of them vnawares?
Whereas the Diuell hath fayned himselfe to bee otherwise
than he is, it hath brought forth innumerable errors,
superstitions, and false worshippings in the Churche of
God. For Bishops in proces of time neglected the word
of God, they would accept the Diuell and receiue him as
an Angell of light, when he came not in a blacke and horrible,
but a pleasaunt and acceptable forme. He speaketh
some good things, that he may intermedle euil things therwith,
he speaketh truth, that he may scatter abroade lyes,
and roote them in mens hearts. So <b>Simon</b>
in <b>Virgil</b>, mingled
falshood with truth, that he might the better entrape
the <b><i>Troians</i></b>.</p>

<p>Sathan doth imitate craftie gamesters, who suffer a
plaine and simple yoong man to winne a while of them,
that afterwards being gr&eacute;edie to play, they may lurch him
of all his golde and siluer. He followeth them which once
or twise iustly repaie vnto their creditors such money as
they haue borrowed, k&eacute;eping their promise duly, that afterwards
they may obtaine a great summe of them, and then
deceiue them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The diuel sometimes vttereth the truth, that his words
may haue the more credit, and that he may the more easily
beguile them. He that would vtter euil wares, doth not only
set them foorth in words, but doth also so trim and decke
them, that they s&eacute;eme excellent good, whereby they are the
more saleable: this Art also the diuel knoweth, for he painteth
out his stuffe that he may obtrude it vnto other men in
<span class="sidenote">Ambrose.</span>
the st&eacute;ede of good ware. S. <b>Ambrose</b> writeth in his Commentaries
vpon the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, and
fift chapter, expounding these words: <b>Quench not the spirit.
Despise not prophecying. Examine all things, and keepe
that which is good.</b> Euill spirites are wont to speake good
things craftily, as it were by imitation, and amongst those
they priuily insinuate wicked thinges, that by meanes of
those things which are good, euil things may be admitted,
and because they are supposed the words of one spirit, they
may not be discerned asunder, but by that which is lawfull
an vnlawfull thing may bee commended by authoritie of
the name, and not by reason of vertue, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why the diuel
doth somtimes
tel truth.</div>

<p>Hereunto appertaine those words which we reade in
<b>S. Chrysostomes</b> second sermon
<b>De Lazara</b>. There he sheweth
that many simple men haue bene in this erroure, that
they haue thought the soules of those which were slaine
by some violent death, did become Diuels. He saith further,
that the Diuell hath perswaded many Witches, and
such as serue him being in this erroure, that they should
kill the tender bodies of many yong men, hoping they shuld
become Diuels, and doo them seruice. And by and by he
addeth: But these things are not true, no, I say, they are
not. What is it then that Diuels say? I am the soule of
such a Monke? Verily I bel&eacute;eue it not, euen for this, that
Diuels doo auouche it: for they deceiue their auditours.
Wherefore <b>Paule</b> also commaundeth them to silence, albeit
they speake truth, lest taking occasion by truth, they
mingle lyes therewith, and so purchase themselues credit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
For when they had said: These men are the seruants
of the most high God, shewing vnto you the way of saluation:

<span class="sidenote"><i>Acts</i>16.</span>

The Apostle not content herewith, commaunded the
prophecying spirite vnto silence, and to come foorth of the
mayd. And yet what harme speake they? These men are
the seruantes of the most high God. But because the most
parte of simple men haue not vnderstanding alwayes to
iudge of those things which are vttered by diuels, he at once

<span class="sidenote"><i>Marke</i>.1.</span>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Luke</i>.4.</span>

excludeth them from all credit. Thou art (saith he) of the
number of infamous spirites, it belongeth not to th&eacute;e to
speake fr&eacute;ely, hold thy peace, k&eacute;epe silence, it is not thy office
to preach. This is the authoritie of the Apostles: why
takest thou vppon th&eacute;e that which appertaineth not vnto
th&eacute;e, hold thy peace, be thou infamous. So also did Christ
sharply rebuke the diuels saying vnto him: We know th&eacute;e
who thou art, therein prescribing vnto vs a lawe, that we
should in no wise trust the diuel, albeit he tell the truth.</p>

<p>Sith we know these things, let vs in no wise bel&eacute;eue
the diuel, nay rather if he say any thing that is truth, let vs
fl&eacute;e from him and shunne him. For it is not lawfull exactly
to learne sounde and wholesome doctrine of diuels, but out
of the holy scriptures.</p>

<p>That you may therfore know that it can in no wise be,
that a soule once departed out of the bodie can come vnder
the tyrannie of the diuell, heare what S. <b>Paule</b> saith: For
he that is dead is iustified from sinne, that is, he sinneth no
more. For if the</p>
<p class="center">diuil can do no hurt vnto the soule while it is in the bodie,<br />
it is euident, he cannot hurt it when it is departed<br />
out of the bodie. &amp;c. By all these<br />
things it is plaine, what manner of<br />
things those are which are<br />
heard and s&eacute;ene.</p>

<p class="center"><b>God by the appearing of Spirits doth exercise the faithfull,<br />
and punish the vnbeleeuers.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_il.png" alt="I" width="150" height="156" />
T foloweth now hereafter to be intreated
of, why God suffreth spirits, ghosts,
and horrible sightes to appeare, &amp;c. And
also why he doth permit other straunge
and miraculous things to happen: And
furthermore, how men ought to behaue
themselues when they s&eacute;e anye suche
things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes why
God suffereth
spirites to appeare.</div>

<p>God doth suffer spirits to appeare vnto his elect, vnto a
good ende, but vnto the reprobate they appeare as a punishment.
And as all other things turne to the best vnto y&#868; faithfull,
euen so doo these also: for if they be good spirits, which
appeare vnto men, warning, and defending them, therby do
they gather the care, prouidence, and fatherly affection of
God towardes them. But in case they bee euill spirites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
(as for the most part they are) the faithfull are moued by
occasion of them vnto true repentance. They looke diligently
vnto themselues so long as they liue, least the enimie
of mankinde, who is readie at all assaies, and lieth
alwaies in waight, should bring them into mischiefe, and
take further vauntage to vexe and hurt them. God also
by these meanes doeth exercise and trie their faith and pacience,
to the end they continue in his word, and receiue nothing
contrary to the same, haue it neuer so faire a shewe,
nor do any manner of thing against his worde, although
those spirites do not straightwayes cease to vexe them.</p>

<p>God doth also suffer them to be exercised with haunting
of spirites, for this cause, that they should be the more humble
and lowely. For in the second Epistle to the Corinth.
and .xii. chap. <b>Paul</b> saith:
And least I should be exalted out
of mesure, through the excellencie of reuelations, ther was
giuen vnto me vnquietnesse through the flesh, euen the
messenger of Sathan to buffet me, because I should not be
exalted out of measure. For this thing besought I the Lord
thrice, that it mighte depart from me. And he said vnto
me: My grace is sufficient for th&eacute;e, for my strength is made
perfect through weakenesse. Except God did shut vp the
way before vs with certaine stops and lets, we should not
know our selues, we shoulde not vnderstande whereof we
stand in n&eacute;ed, we should not so earnestly pray vnto God, to
deliuer vs from euill, to strengthen our faith, and to giue
vs patience, and other necessarie things. Neither should
we be touched with compassion of other mennes miserie
which are vexed with spirits: but we woulde rather say,
that they cannot tell what they speake, and that they imagine
many vaine feares. Moreouer, if other vnderstande
that godly men are for their exercise vexed by spirits, they
become more patient whensoeuer they are sicke, or otherwise
troubled, acknowledging their owne harmes to be
but small in comparison of other mens. For nothing is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
more gr&eacute;euous, than when a man is tormented by the
Diuel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seeing of spirites
to the
wicked is a
punishment.</div>

<p>Now as touching infidells, they are constrained, will
they, or nill they, to confesse, that there are diuels, for there
are many which would neuer be persuaded, there are good
or euill Angels or spirits, except sometimes they had experience
thereof indeede. God suffereth these things to chasten
them. For so muche as they will giue no place vnto
truth, but are wilfully deceiued, it is good reason they be
taught by diuellish illusions what they must doo, or leaue
vndone, and that they be illuded by euil spirits, after some
other meanes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Deut.</i> 13.</div>

<p>Thus we reade in the 13. chapter of Deuteronomie: if
there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreames,
and giue th&eacute;e a signe and wonder, and that signe or wonder
that he hath saide come to passe, and then say, let vs goe after
straunge Gods, which thou hast not knowne, and let
vs serue them: heark&#275; not thou vnto the words of that prophet,
or dreamer of dreames. For the Lorde thy God proueth
you, to wit, whether ye loue the Lord your God with
all your soule. Ye shall walke after the Lorde your God
and feare him, k&eacute;epe his commandements, and hearken vnto
his voice, serue him and cleaue vnto him. And he addeth
further, that the same prophet or dreamer shall die the
death.</p>

<p>By these words we do not only s&eacute;e that God doth suffer
suche lewde fellowes to worke maruellous thinges, but
also to what ende and purpose he permitteth it, that is, to
trie his faithfull, how constant they be, and how faithfully
they would bel&eacute;eue in him, if at any time spirits do come
and foretell things to happen hereafter. Our Sauiour

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn</i> 3.</span>

Christ saith in the third Chapter of Saint <b>Iohn</b>: This
is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loued darknesse more than light, because their deedes
were euill: for euery one that doth euill, hateth the light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
neither commeth he to the light, least his d&eacute;edes should be
reproued, &amp;c. By the which words our Sauiour sheweth
the cause why the worlde is condemned, which is, because
they receiue not the light of the word of God, or Christe
himselfe, who is the light of the worlde, set foorth vnto vs
in his word: but rather shut their eyes against the cleare
light, preferring darkenesse, that is, errors, superstition,
and wickednesse, before the word of God. If God then condemne
and reiect the vnthankfull world, what maruell is
it, if hee vexe them with spirites and vaine apparitions?

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn</i> 5.</span>

Christ saieth in the fifth of <b>Iohn</b>, I come in my Fathers
name, and you receiue m&eacute;e not: If an other come in his
owne name, you receiue him.</p>

<p>Christe laboured for their health and saluation: this they
would not acknowledge, but refused him: therefore was it
the iust iudgement of God, that they shuld receiue others,
that hunted after their owne commoditie and profit: suche
as were <b>Theudas</b>, <b>Iudas</b>
of <b><i>Galilee</i></b>, and many other false
doctors, and seditious seducers. Wherefore if any refuse
to giue eare to Christ and his Ministers, it is by the iust
iudgement of God, that they hearken vnto spirites, and

<span class="sidenote">2. <i>Thessa.</i> 2.</span>

suche lyke things. Sainte <b>Paule</b> in the seconde to the
Thessalonians and second Chapter, writeth of Antichrist,
that he shoulde exercise great tyrannie in the Churche of
God, and sheweth against whome, and for what cause
God will suffer him so to doo, saying: Among them that
perish: because they receiued not the loue of the truth that
they might be saued. And therefore God shall send them
strong delusions, that they shoulde bel&eacute;eue lyes, that all
they might be damned, whiche bel&eacute;eue not the truth, but
had pleasure in vnrighteousnesse. And in the fourth Chapter

<span class="sidenote">2. <i>Timo.</i> 4.</span>

of his seconde Epistle to Timothie, he earnestly bes&eacute;echeth
his scholler to be diligent in preaching daily. He giueth
this reason: for the time will come, when they shall
not suffer wholesome doctrine: but after their owne lustes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
shall they (whose eares itche,) get them an heape of teachers,
and shall withdrawe their eares from the truth, and
shalbe turned vnto fables. Now we s&eacute;e the cause why god
dothe suffer seducers, false teachers, and wicked spirites,
to deceiue men in the place of true doctours: which is, for
that eyther they vtterly despise his woorde or little est&eacute;eme
it, and cannot abide godly and constant preachers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples of
the Wicked

spirits pharao.
Exodus.</div>

<p>Touching whiche matter, w&eacute;e will alleage a fewe examples.
<b>Pharao</b> contemned God and his seruants, <b>Moyses</b>
and <b>Aaron</b>, wherefore God blinded his eyes, that he
gaue himselfe to be ruled by his <b>Magi</b> or wise men, and at
the last perished miserably in the red Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Samuel.</div>

<p><b>Saule</b> would not giue eare vnto
<b>Samuell</b>, who bare
a right hart and good affection towards his king: he loued
him not (as by reason he shoulde haue done) but hated
him, and all other that loued him right well, for he contemnned
the woorde of God. Wherefore it came to passe, that being
in extreme daunger, he sought helpe of a witch to reare
<b>Samuel</b> from the dead, y&#877; he might now vse his aduise, wh&#333;
he dispised beeing aliue, and disdained to heare him. This
woman reareth one, who is no otherwise called <b>Samuell</b>,
than when false gods, are called gods, when in very d&eacute;ede
they are not gods, but wood and stones, or rather <b>Paul</b>

<span class="sidenote">1. <i>Cor.</i>10.</span>

saith) .1. Corin. 10. very diuels. This counterfeit <b>Samuel</b>
giueth him neither comfort nor Counsell, but driueth him
to vtter desperation. The same hapned vnto <b>Saule</b> which
chaunceth vnto those stubborne children, whiche despise
their parents, contemne their counsel, &amp; would gladly wish
their death, and at the last grow vnto y&#868; point, y&#877; they would
willingly take in hand a great iorney on condition it might
be graunted them to heare them giue their last counsell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Achab.</div>

<p>An other example hereof. <b>Achab</b> king of Israel,
&amp; <b>Iezabel</b>
his wife had many godly prophets, amongst wh&#333; <b>Elias</b> was
a man indued with the gifte of the wing and working miracles.
But they did not only cont&#275;ne these prophets, but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
cruelly murthered so many of them as they coulde catche.
Yet amongst the rest, they especially laboured to intrape
<b>Elias</b>, who was exc&eacute;eding zealous.
The <b>Baalamites</b> were in
greate fauoure with the King: but especially with the
Qu&eacute;ene, as her chief dearlings. And when the time approched,

<span class="sidenote">3. <i>Reg.</i> 22.</span>

that <b>Achab</b> should suffer due and worthie punishment
for his Idolatrie and wickednesse, wherein he had
long time liued, he entred councell with his kinsman <b>Iosaphat</b>,
that they ioyning their powers togither might recouer
againe the Citie of <b><i>Ramoth Gilead</i></b>, which the <b>Assirians</b>
had taken from him. <b>Iosaphat</b> allowed well this
deuise, notwithstanding h&eacute;e woulde in any wise aske
counsaile h&eacute;erein of God. <b>Achab</b>, therefore gathereth
togither a Councell of 400. priests of <b>Baall</b>, who all with
one voyce, exhorted him to goe on with his enterprise, assuring
him of most certaine victorie. One of them named
<b>Sedechias</b>, was so vainly bold, that putting hornes of yron
on his head, he saide: With these hornes shalt thou pushe
the <b>Assirians</b>. But <b>Iosaphat</b> suspecting the matter, asked if
there were any one Prophet of God to be found, of whome
they might s&eacute;eke counsell. <b>Achab</b> answered: There is
(quoth he) yet a certaine man by whom we might enquire
of the Lorde, but I hate him, for he doth not prophecie good
vnto me, but euill, his name is <b>Micheas</b>. <b>Iosaphat</b> thought
good in any wise to heare him. Wherfore the king presently
sent for him by one of his Chamberlaines. And thus the
messenger spake vnto him. All the Prophets with one
voice, prophecie good lucke vnto the king, I pray th&eacute;e therefore,
that thou speake nothing to the contrary. When he
was nowe brought before the two kings sitting in their
thrones, clad with sumptuous apparell, and before the other
Prophets, which stood in their presence, king <b>Achab</b>
asked him, whether they should make warres against <b><i>Ramoth
Gilead</i></b>, or no? Vnto whom he scoffingly answered: go
(saith he) thou shalt haue prosperous successe. The king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who by the maner of his vtterance, vnderstood he spake
not in earnest, instantly required him to tell him the
truth. Wherevppon he saide: that he had s&eacute;ene all <b><i>Israell</i></b>
dispersed in the mountaines, as sh&eacute;ep without a shepheard,
and that the Lorde had saide: These men haue no Lorde,
let euery one returne home to his owne house in safetie.
Then saide <b>Achab</b>, Did I not tell th&eacute;e, that this fellow
both prophecie me no good? The Prophet went on, saying:
Heare the word of God: I sawe the Lord sitting in his
seate of maiestie, and all the hoste of heauen stande about
him on his right hande, and on his lefte hande. And the
Lorde saide, Who shall entice <b>Achab</b> that he may go and
fall at <b><i>Ramoth Gilead</i></b>. And one saide on this manner,
and an other saide on that manner. Then there came
foorth a spirit, and stoode before the Lorde and saide, I will
entice him. And the Lorde saide vnto him, wherewith?
And he saide, I will goe out and be a false spirite in the
mouth of all his Prophets. Then he saide, thou shalt entice
him, and shalt also preuaile: go foorth and do so. Now
therefore beholde, the Lord hath put a lying spirite in the
mouth of all these thy Prophets, and the Lorde hath appointed
euill against th&eacute;e. Then <b>Sedechias</b> came neare and
smote <b>Micheas</b> on the ch&eacute;eke, and saide: when went the
spirit of the Lord from me, to speake vnto th&eacute;e? And <b>Micheas</b>
prophecied what should happen also vnto him. So
the king commaunded him to be cast into prison, and to be
fed with bread and water vntil he returned from the wars.
Then saide <b>Micheas</b>, If thou returne in peace, the Lorde
hath not spoken by me: and therewith he willed all the
people to hearken what he spake. Notwithstanding the
kings went foreward with their enterprise, and prepared
themselues, and led foorth their armies against their enemies.
<b>Achab</b> was slaine in the battaile: <b>Iosaphat</b> because
he ioyned himselfe with the wicked, was in very great
daunger, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>I haue handled this historie somewhat at large, that
we might vnderstand, how God by his iust iudgement sendeth
spirites vnto those which despise his word, whereby
they may be beguiled and deceiued.</p>

<p>The very same happened vnto the Christians after the
Apostles time. For when the word of God began to be lesse
est&eacute;emed than it should haue bene, and men preferred their
owne affections before the hearing thereof: and when as
they would incurre no maner of daunger, for the defence of
their faith, and of the truth, but accounted of all religions
alike, God so punished them, that now they began to giue
eare vnto false teachers, whiche framed themselues vnto
their vaine affections, they learned of images, whom they
called Lay-mens bookes, they kissed these mens bones, and
shrined them in golde (if happily they were their boanes)
whose doctrine before they disdained to receiue: they gaue
credit vnto false apparitions and diuellish visions: and so
suffered they worthie punishment for their great ingratitude.
Euen as yoong men, which will not be ruled by their
maisters, are after compelled to obey other men with great
shame: so also happened it vnto those men: for they fel daily
more and more from the word of God, in so much that
when they had once lost the truthe, some ranne one way,
and some an other, to finde a meanes for the remission of
their sinnes: and one man bel&eacute;eued this spirite, an other
that, which no man can deny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rom.</i> 1.</div>

<p>The like chaunced vnto the Gentiles in times past, as
it appeareth by the first chap. to the Romanes, and also by
their owne writings. They worshipped many gods, many
miracles were shewed amongst them: they had many visions
of gods, and many oracles: which when the Apostles

<span class="sidenote">Athanasius.</span>

began to preach, all ceased. S. <b>Athanasius</b>
in his booke <b>De humanitate verbi.</b>
<b>Fol.</b> 55. and 64. writeth, that in auncient
time there were oracles at <b><i>Delphos</i></b> in
<b><i>B&oelig;otia</i></b>,

He cleare light of Gods word driueth away
all such spirits, which vse to worke
their feates in the darke. The cleare
light approaching, the shadow &amp; darkenesse
vanisheth. The prince of darknesse
shunneth light, and hath nothing to doo
where men worship God the Father,
only through Iesu Christ, bel&eacute;euing only
on him, and committing themselues wholy vnto his protection.
If men est&eacute;em the word of God, and haue it in price,
he will in no wise suffer them to be so ouers&eacute;ene and deceiued,
as they are which do all things without the warrant
of his word.</p>

<p>Here I cannot ouerpasse with silence a certaine merry
iest: when once there chaunced to be talke in a certaine
place of visions and spirites, a certaine professour of
the Gospell saide vnto a Papist in this maner: You ought
(quoth he) euen by this to gather, that our religion is
true, and youres false, for that since the Gospell was preached
vnto vs, very fewe spirits haue bin s&eacute;ene of any man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
To whome the other made aunswere by way of reasoning
called <b>Violentum</b>: Nay (saith h&eacute;e) hereby ye may gather,
that your religion is naught, and oures good: for the diuell
assaulteth those, whome he feareth will shortly reuolte from
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A storie of S.
Benedict, seing
many diuels in
a monastery
and fewe in
the market.</div>

<p>It is not much vnlike whiche <b>Æneas Siluius</b> (who was
afterwardes made Pope, called <b>Pius</b> .2.) reciteth in his Historie
of the Councell of <b><i>Basill</i></b>, out of the life of holy <b>Benedict</b>,
father of the Monkes called after his name. H&eacute;e
sometimes visiting a certaine Monasterie of holy men,
espyed an infinite route of diuels, who as it were fighting
with the holy fathers, laboured to disturbe the good workes
which they went about. And he forthwith going to a faire
full of marchandise and buying and selling, sawe there but
one diuell, and he also idle and sad, sitting vppon a watch-toure,
wherat saint <b>Benedict</b> maruelling, that he saw the
place which was holy and dedicate to praier, full of diuels,
and that he founde the prophane place which was occupied
with periurie and other offences, guarded but with one
Diuell: coniures the same Diuell to declare and shewe
vnto him the true cause thereof: who straight answered
him, that it was n&eacute;edfull the holy place shoulde be assaulted
by many diuels, but those which sinned of their
voluntarie accorde, had no n&eacute;ede to b&eacute;e deceiued by the
Diuell.</p>

<p>But I aske th&eacute;e this question O thou Papist, mighte
not the Gentils in ancient time haue obiected the same to
the Christians, when they demaunded of them why their
Oracles ceassed? and why there were so fewe Visions?
If those Spirites or bugges be Diuels, why doe you then
saye and bel&eacute;eue that they are the soules of deade menne,
whiche desire helpe of you? I will shewe you the verye
true cause why those visions are nowe so seldome
times s&eacute;ene: forsoothe because the Diuell perceiueth, that
w&eacute;e vnderstande his subtilties and craft, therefore h&eacute;e
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hunteth after other men, and s&eacute;eketh to deceiue them. As for
example, when thou wilt crampe some man by the toes in
night time (as sometimes pleasant fellowes vse to do, to recreate
themselues when they trauell) and so draw him out
of his bedde, if thou perceiue he bee acquainted with thy
sleight, by and by thou leauest him, and goest vnto an other
which is fast a sleep, and cannot perceiue the deceit.</p>

<p>There be other causes also why these things happen now
more sildome. If any man deceiue th&eacute;e once, twice, or thrice,
afterwards thou openest thy eyes, and espiest what he doth
and what he goeth about: so when we haue bene often beguiled
with false apparitions, we will not easily be persuaded,
if any man tell vs that a soule or spirite hath appeared

<span class="sidenote">A burnt child
dreads fire.</span>

(as the prouerbe saith,) Burnt childe, dreads fire. Moreouer,
whereas now adayes fewe stand in feare of spirits, many
might be easily found, who would s&eacute;ek them, f&eacute;ele them,
yea and also handle them. This is well knowne, and therefore
no man will gladly put on a visor, or otherwise counterfeit
himselfe to be a ghost. A man may soone persuade a
childe that there is a black man, a tall woman, which will
put children that cry in their budget, &amp;c. but after they are
come to maturitie of yeares, they will no more bee feared
with visours and such like persuasions: they will laugh at
thy follie, if afterwards thou goe about to make them so afraide.
Euen so when we were children in the scriptures,
that is, when we vnderstood them not, we might be easily
seduced to bel&eacute;eue many things: But nowe that we reade
them in all manner of tongues, and do daily profit in them,
we do not suffer our selues to be so mocked, neither doo we
bel&eacute;eue euery vaine apparition. How many sights of spirits
did the knauerie of the Monkes of <b><i>Berna</i></b>driue away, after
it was once detected? Things are set vp in the fields to feare
away the birdes, which at the last also they perceiue to be
but trifles, and are not driuen away any longer with suche
toyes. What maruel is it then, if after so great a shipwrack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of godlinesse and truth, men albeit they are simple, doo at

<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>Why God doth suffer straunge noyses, or extraordinarie<br />
rumblings to bee heard before some notable alterations<br />
or otherwise.</b></p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_il.png" alt="I" width="150" height="156" />
N that there happeneth certaine straunge things before
the death of men, and also before notable alterations, and
destructions of countries, as maruellous crackes, and terrible
roaring, surely it turneth to good vnto the iust, and to
further damnation to the wicked. For by these means God
sheweth that nothing commeth to passe by chance, or by aduenture,
but that the life and death, the prosperous or vnfortunate
estate of al men, is in the power and hand of God.
It is nothing so as the Epicures affirme, that God hath no
regard whether any man liue, or be borne, or do well or euill,
or otherwise, or whether comm&#333; wealths do florish, or
be made waste. Christ himself teacheth vs, that not so much
as a sparrow falleth vnto the grounde without the will of
God. <b>Salomon</b> and <b>Daniel</b>
say, that the hearts of kings are
in Gods hands, and that he appointeth or deposeth kings at
his pleasure. Wherfore if we happily do heare any noises or
such like, they ought rather to put vs in good comfort, th&#257; to
make vs afraide. And againe, God hereby admonisheth vs,
that we be not idle and secure, for he hath in all ages stirred
vp his seruants, not only with word, but also with rare and
straunge apparitions. The very Gentiles accounted these
miraculous things, as the admonitions and warnings of
their gods, and it may be s&eacute;en euery where, in their histories.
And albeit it be very likely, that most of these things happen
by the diuels procurement, yet neuerthelesse, we herein
perceiue Almightie God his fatherly care, loue, and preseruati&#333;
of vs against y&#868; deuises of the diuel. For albeit the
diuel take no rest, but is alwayes in readinesse to destroy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
vs, yet can he not hurt vs, so long as God k&eacute;epeth watche
and defendeth vs. The wicked who despise the preaching of
Gods word, are sore terrified with these things, in so much
that they not knowing whither to turne themselues, are
constrained to confesse, that God doth gouerne all mens
actions, and that there are good and euil spirits. Otherwise
they coulde in no case be repressed, but that they would doo
greater mischiefe vnto the faithfull, except God by these
meanes did cast feare vppon them, and as it were with a
snaffle or bridle, did hale and drawe them backe.</p>

<p class="center"><b>After what sort they should behaue themselues, whiche<br />

<p class="drop-cap">THat we may rightly vnderstand how we ought to behaue

<span class="sidenote">What the G&#275;tiles
did when they sawe spirits.</span>

<span class="sidenote">Suetonius.</span>

our selues, if any thing either good or euill, appeare
vnto vs, we wil first declare how the Gentiles
and Iewes vsed themselues in like cases. Amongst the
Gentiles, not only those wandring spirits beare men in
hand that they were mens soules, but also shewed what
were good and expedient for them to doo for their sake, to
wit, that they should do sacrifices for their soules, obserue
their obsequies, burie their bodies, erect Temples, make
holy dayes, and such like stuffe. <b>Suetonius</b> writeth, that the
Emperor <b>Caligule</b> his bodie was priuily conueyed into the
gardeins called <b><i>Lamiam</i></b>, and there with a hastie fire being
but halfe consumed, was cast into a pit, and couered with a
litle earth. But afterwards, wh&#275; his sisters returned from
exile, it was taken vp, and thorowly burnt, and afterward
solemnly buried. But before they had so done, the gard&#275; k&eacute;epers
were very much troubled with appearing of spirites.
And moreouer, no man could passe any night in the same
house where he was slaine, without some great feare, vntil
such time as the house was vtterly destroyed with fire.</p>

Anniuersaria.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lilius Giraldus.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cicero.</div>

<p>We read also in other writers, that the ghostes of them
which were not orderly buried, or whose accustomed rites
and ceremonies in the time of warres were omitted, did
appeare either to their friendes or vnto others, complayning
and intreating that their funerals, and all other ceremonies
might be obserued for their sake: whereof came the
hearses, w&eacute;ekemindes, monthmindes, and anniuersaries,
whereof we reade many things in the Ethnike writers,
and many things are recited out of the olde Poets, and in
<b>Lilius Giraldus</b>, in his booke
<b><i>De sepultura</i></b>, and also in <b>Polid.
Virgilius</b> <b><i>De Inuentione rerum</i>.<i>lib.cap.10</i></b>. We haue shewed
before in the second part and first Chapter, that some haue
desired others, that they might bee buried after that they
were dead. <b>Cicero</b> writeth in his 1. booke <b><i>De legibus</i></b>, that
<b>Romulus</b> the first founder of <b><i>Rome</i></b>, walking after his death
not farre from <b>Atticus</b> house, appeared vnto <b>Iulius Proculus</b>,
and told him that he was now a god, and that his name
was <b>Quirinus</b>, and therwith commanded that there should
be a Temple erected and dedicated vnto him in the same
place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ouid.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Feralia.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Parentalia.</div>

<p><b>Ouid</b> writeth <b><i>Lib.</i>4. <i>Fastorum</i></b>,
that Remus appeared in
the night time vnto <b>Fastulus</b>,
and to his wife <b>Accia Laurentia</b>,
sometime his Nurse, complaining vnto them of his miserable
death, and desiring them to make laboure, that the
same day wherein he was slaine, might bee accounted amongst
their holy dayes. The people of <b><i>Rome</i></b> (as <b>Ouid</b>
witnesseth, <b><i>Lib.</i>2. <i>Fastorum</i>)</b> kept a feast in the moneth of
Februarie called <b><i>Feralia</i></b>, in the which they did sacrifice
vnto the infernall goddes, and those whose duties it was
to celebrate the funeralls of their Auncesters, carried dishes
of meat to their sepulchers. Whereof <b>Fastus</b> and <b>Varro</b>
called the same feast by the name of <b><i>Feralia</i></b>. These
dishes of meate were set vpon a stone, at the time of these
sacrifices: for the which cause, as <b>Seruius</b> saith, they were
called <b><i>Silicernium</i></b>, by the which word some will haue a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
certaine feast signified, which is bestowed vppon old men.
<b>Donatus</b> sayth, that <b><i>Silicernium</i></b> is a supper, which is made
to the infernall Gods, because <b><i>Eam silentes cernant</i></b>, that
is, the deade soules do receiue it, or because those that doe
serue it, do onely <b><i>cernere</i></b>, s&eacute;e it, and not taste thereof, &amp;c.
There were also certaine holie feastes called <b><i>Parentalia</i></b>,
in the which meate was carried to the Sepulchers, for the
soules of Parents and Auncestours before deceased. And
albeit they suppose, that soules were pleased with small
giftes, as of milke, wine, and such like, whereof mention
is made in <b>Ouid</b>, yet notwithstanding they also killed
sacrifices, whereof some suppose that <b><i>Feralia</i></b> tooke their
name, <b><i>à feriendis pecudibus</i></b>, of killing sh&eacute;epe. Vnto their sacrifices
they also added praiers, and kindled lightes. When
in times past the Romanes being troubled with warres,
had let passe the feast of <b><i>Parentalia</i></b>, they therefore supposed
(that the infernall Goddes being for the same cause
angrie) there arose stormes and pestilence, and that soules
rising out of their graues, did wander with pittifull complaintes
about the graues, and by the highway sides, and
in the fieldes. This feaste endured by the space of fift&eacute;ene
dayes, in the whiche married women lay not with their
husbandes, neither those whiche were marriageable did
marrie, and the Images of their Goddes were couered.
The soules of them that were dead, when they came to
the meate, they wandred about the graues, and were fed (as
they thought) with the banquet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lemuria.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ouid.</div>

<p>In the moneth of May, there was holden a feast in the
night time, which at the beginning they called <b><i>Remuria</i></b>,
and afterwardes <b><i>Lemuria</i></b>. This did not differ much from
the feaste called <b><i>Feralia</i></b>, whiche was instituted to pacifie
soules. Touching the originall of them, and the rytes belonging
therto, looke <b>Ouid</b> in his <b><i>Lib.</i>5. <i>Fastorum</i></b>. One who
tooke on him to pacifie the soules, arose in the night verie
late, he went barefooted, and washed himselfe ouer with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
fresh springing water, and then taking beanes whiche he
had rolled in his mouth, he threw them behinde his backe,
and said, that with them he did red&eacute;eme himselfe, and after
beating on a p&eacute;ece of brasse, he prayed the soules to depart
from thence: which thing if they had done nine times, they
thought they had ended their holy seruice. These were celebrated
by the space of thr&eacute;e dayes. The sacrifices which
are done for the infernall gods, are called <b><i>Inferiæ</i></b>.</p>

<p>We reade in <b>Lucan</b>, of the soules of
<b>Sylla</b> and <b>Marius</b>,
which were purged by sacrifice. We shewed before how
<b>Athanagoras</b> commanded the bones which were digged vp
in the entrie of his house at <b><i>Athens</i></b>, to bee orderly buried
againe. &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Touching the
Iewes behauiour.</div>

<p>The auncient Iewes had an expresse commandement
of God, not to bee any thing moued with the miracles of
false Prophets, and God in plaine words forbad them, not
to s&eacute;eke counsel of dead bodies.<b>Saule</b> in the beginning of
his raigne, while he yet gaue himselfe vnto godlinesse, vtterly
destroyed all Coniurers and Witches. I doo not remember
that I haue euer heard or read, how the Iewes
behaued themselues when any spirits appeared vnto them:
yet I doubt not but that they are superstitious as well in
these things, as in all others.</p>

<h2>CHAP. V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>How Christian men ought to behaue themselues when<br />
they see Spirites, and first that they ought to haue a<br />
good courage, and to be stedfast in faith.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">HOwe Christian menne oughte to behaue themselues
in this behalfe, it is fully and amply declared
in the holie Scriptures, in like manner
as all other things are, whiche appertaine vnto
our saluation. To wit, that first we ought to be of good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
courage without feare, being assured and constante in true
faith.</p>

<p>For if they be good Angels which shew themselues vnto
vs, then are they sent vnto vs from God, to a good ende
and purpose. But if they be wicked and euill, they can do
vs no harme be they neuer so desirous, excepte God giue
them leaue thereto. If it be nothing but a vaine imagination
that we haue, or an idle sight obiected vnto our eies,
surely it is great follie to be any thing afraid. In d&eacute;ed it is
naturall vnto vs, to be amazed with feare when we s&eacute;e
suche things: for very godly menne, as we read both in
the olde and newe Testament, were stricken with exc&eacute;eding
feare when they sawe good Angels, but yet a man
must pull vp his heart againe. When Christes Disciples
sawe their Maister walking vpon the water, and approching
neare the shippe, they thought they sawe a spirite,
and they were astonished, and cried out through feare. But
the Lorde saide vnto them, be of good comforte, it is I, be
not afraide.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Luke</i> .24.</div>

<p>The like is reade in the foure and twentie Chapter
of Saint Luke, when he appeared vnto them after his
resurrection, and sawe that they were maruellously afraid.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Matth.</i> 10.</span>

Matthew the 10. Feare not saithe Christ, those whiche
slay the bodie, but cannot kill the soule, but rather stande
in awe of him, who can cast both bodie and soule into hell
fire. The Diuell would like it well, if we would alwaies
stand in feare of him.</p>

<p>Be not dismaide, although thou heare some spirit stir
and make a noise, for in case hee rumble onely to make
th&eacute;e afraide, care not for him, but lette him rumble so
long as he will, for if he s&eacute;e th&eacute;e without feare, h&eacute;e
will soone depart from th&eacute;e. And if thou thinke good, thou
maiest boldly say vnto him, get th&eacute;e hence with a mischiefe
thou wicked Diuell, thou hast nothing to do with me, who
haue sette my onely bel&eacute;efe in Christ Iesu my Sauiour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>I am owner of this house, and not thou, vnto whome there
is an other place appointed. &amp;c. If he perceiue y&#877; there is no
feare or dreade of him, and that his bustling is not est&eacute;emed,
he will not continue long time. I will make this
matter manifest with a similitude, which is well knowne.
There be certaine men, which if they thinke other men
stande in feare of them, they make wise to drawe their
sworde, and sometimes two they draw it, and strike the
stones therewith, chafing and swearing lustily: But if they
knowe their aduersaries haue a good courage, and that (if
n&eacute;ede require) they will fight it out stoutly, they will quickly
put vp their sworde into their scabberde. In like manner,
if the Diuill s&eacute;e thou art of a good stomacke, and well
armed with Gods worde, he will soone s&eacute;eke after others
whome he may mocke with feare.</p>

<p>But if it please God to exercise th&eacute;e by the Deuill for a
certaine time, as he did sometime <b>Iob</b>, thou must patiently
suffer all things which he laieth vppon th&eacute;e, and that willingly
for Gods commaundement sake. And knowe thou
well, that he cannot thus much hurt, neither thy goods, nor
bodie, nor soule, without the permissi&#333; and sufferance of Almightie
God: if God giue him leaue to plague thy bodie,
thinke with thy selfe howe so euer it be done, that God hath
so doone for thy profitte and commoditie, who also sendeth
gr&eacute;euous sicknesses vppon other men, by other meanes &amp; instruments,
or else doth exercise them with other kindes of
calamities. Be therefore strong and constant in faith, yet
lette euery one beware of boldnesse, temeritie, and headdie
rashnesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ hath
conquered
the diuel.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Luke</i> 11.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Iohn</i>.12.16.</div>

<p>Let it comforte th&eacute;e, that thou knowest Christe hath conquired
the Deuill, as he himselfe teacheth in the eleuenth
chapter of Luke, by the example of a strong man at armes.
In the 12.&amp;.16. of Iohn he saith: the Prince of this worlde
shalbe cast out of the doores, that is to say, out of the hearts
of them which cleaue to the worde of God, and are not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
loue with the world, whereof he is prince and ruler. For he
hath power ouer such, which do gr&eacute;edily loue the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. <i>Iohn</i> .3.</div>

<p>In the first of <b>Iohn</b> the third chapter, it is saide: The
sonne of man appeared, that is, came into the world for that
cause, that he might destroy the workes of the diuel. There
are many miracles in the Gospell which shewe that Christ
cast out diuels. Albeit God for a time do suffer the diuel in
many things, yet hath he appointed him his bounds, which
he may not passe. And he doth not suffer the faithfull to be
tempted any more of him than they are able to endure. He
giueth his grace plentuously vnto them, vpon whome he
laieth great afflictions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The diuel is
conuersant among
men.</div>

<p>We ought not to maruel if spirits sometimes be s&eacute;en or
heard. For as Saint <b>Peter</b> saith: Sathan raungeth euery
where, in houses, fieldes, water and fire: and yet he is not
alwayes espied of men, neither can he so bee, except God
giue him leaue to shewe himselfe. In that that we doe alwayes
s&eacute;e him (for he being of an inuisible nature, taketh
on him diuers shapes) or heare him, we haue to thanke the
goodnesse of almightie God: for otherwise we should not be
in rest one moment of time. But if sometime wicked spirits
m&eacute;ete with vs in a visible forme by the will of God, or
do otherwise trouble and disquiet our houses, we must not
think therfore that they were neuer in house before.</p>

greate difference of men liuing vnder the newe
Testament, from them that liue vnder the olde,
vnto whom God many and oftentimes sent his Angels)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and that euill angels very often appeare, we ought the rather
to commit our selues more diligently to the tuition of
almightie God, both when we go to bed, and also when we
arise againe.</p>

<p>Our Sauiour amongst all other things, taught vs to
pray to this purpose: <b>Deliuer vs from euill</b>. And moreouer
he saith in the 17. Chapter of <b>Matthew</b>, that some kinde of
diuels are not driuen away by any other kinde of meanes
than fasting and praying. As touching those which suppose
that diuels ought to be cast out with coniurations, and execrable
cursings, I will intreat in the end of this my booke.
Watch and pray, least ye fall into temptation. <b>Matthew</b> 26.
And in the 22. of <b>Luke</b>, Christ saith vnto <b>Peter</b>, Sathan
hath desired to sift you euen as corne, but I haue praied that
thy faith faile not. And euen at this present also he maketh
intercession for vs sitting at the right hand of his heauenly
father.</p>

<p>The auncient Fathers in olde time, call vppon God
in all their daungers and troubles, whereof it were a n&eacute;edlesse
matter to auouch many examples. It is also very profitable
and good to craue the prayers of the whole congregation,
whensoeuer we are vexed with euill spirites and
vaine fantasies. For we know right well that the prayers
of the Church haue bene very profitable and effectuall
vnto others, and that the godly in their distresses haue euermore
desired them.</p>

<p>It is Gods pleasure, that the faithfull should succour
one an other with their good prayers. Howbeit that the
Saintes after their departure from hence, should pray for
vs, that we should in any wise desire their prayers, surely
there is no commandement of God, or any example thereof
in the holy scriptures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ephe.</i>6.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1. <i>Pet.</i>5.</div>

<p>Moreouer, the Apostles teach vs to withstand the craft
and subtiltie of the diuell by this meanes. Saint <b>Paule</b> to
the Ephesians the 6. Chapter, and <b>Peter</b> on his first Epistle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and fifth Chapter saith: Be ye sober and watche, for your
aduersary the diuel, as a roaring lyon walketh about, s&eacute;eking
whom he may deuoure: whome resist stedfast in faith,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">We must fight
against the diuel
with good
life.</div>

<p>When men are secure and negligent, wholly giuen
vnto pleasures and as it were drowned in surfetting, couetousnesse,
adulterie, and such other wickednesse, then hath
the diuel place to shewe himselfe. Wherefore we ought to
giue our selues to watching, praying, fasting, and godly liuing:
we must heare the word of God often and gladly, we
must desire to reade and talke of him continually, that we
may thereby put from vs those diuellishe illusions and
sightes.</p>

<p>If thou haue any publike office or charge, do it faithfully:
restore thy goods euil gotten, either vnto their true owners,
or else imploy them to some good and godly ende. If
men care neither for God, nor his word, it is no maruell if
vaine sightes appeare vnto them. For God suffereth such
things to happen vnto them, to humble them and to make
them know themselues.</p>

<p>It is an horrible thing, that there are some which giue
ouer themselues to the diuel, because he should not torment
them: they ought rather to weigh with themselues, that if
they so do, they shall be perpetually tormented of euil spirits,
except they truly repent and turne againe to God.</p>

<p class="center"><b>That spirits which vse to appeare, ought to be iustly suspected:<br />
and that we may not talke with them, nor enquire<br />
any thing of them.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE ought not without great cause to suspecte all
Spirites, and other apparitions. For albeit God
doth vse the helpe and seruice of good Angels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
for the preseruation of his elect, yet notwithstanding in
these our dayes they appeare vnto vs very sildome. For
things are nowe farre otherwise since Christes comming
into the worlde, than they were before in auncient time.
Although perchaunce thou thinke thou haste s&eacute;ene a good
Angell, yet doo not easily and vnaduisedly giue him credite.
If the euent of the matter declare afterward, that it
was a good Angell, which gaue th&eacute;e notable warning of
some matter, or deliuered th&eacute;e out of some great dangers:
giue God thankes that he hath dealt so fatherly and mercifully
with th&eacute;e, and hath suche care ouer th&eacute;e, and endeuour
to frame thy selfe to his wil and pleasure. But if thou
s&eacute;e an Angell which flattereth and speaketh th&eacute;e faire,
suche a one of those are whiche craue thy helpe, (as thou
hast heard before) in no wise credite their wordes. Men
which blaunche and flatter with vs, are alwayes suspitious,
why then should not such spirites be suspected? Enter
into no communication with such spirites, neither aske
them what thou must giue, or what thou must doo, or what
shall happen hereafter. Aske them not who they are, or
why they haue presented themselues to bee s&eacute;ene or heard.
For it they be good, they will like it well, that thou wilt
heare nothing but the world of God: but if they be wicked,
they will endeuour to deceiue th&eacute;e with lying. When the

<span class="sidenote"><i>Matth.</i> 1.</span>

Angell in the first Chapter of <b>Matthew</b>,
instructed <b>Ioseph</b>
in a dreame, he by and by alleaged testimony out of the prophet.
If it be so, that we must not bel&eacute;eue an Angell comming
from heauen, who can iustly blame vs, if we giue no
credite to spirits and suspitious dreames? Although Christ
and his Apostles had the full power to shew miracles, yet
did they establish and confirme their doctrine by the holie
scriptures.</p>

<p>When Almightie God himselfe had enquired of <b>Adam</b>
in Paradice, touching the breaking of his Commaundement,
and that he had layde the fault vpon his wife <b>Eue</b>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and she had put it ouer to the Serpent, which caused her
to eate of the forbidden frute, God woulde not demaund
of the Serpent, that is, of the Diuell, (whiche had vsed
him as an instrument) why he had so done, for he knewe
right well that he was a lyer. Except <b>Eue</b> had talked with
the Serpent, she had neuer transgressed Gods Commandement.</p>

<p>If Spirites of their owne accorde woulde gladly tell
vs many thinges: yet w&eacute;e must not giue eare vnto them,
much lesse ought we to coniure them to tell vs the truthe.
God commaunded in his lawe, (as w&eacute;e haue oftentimes
said before) that no man should enquire any thing of the
dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God hath alwayes giuen vs teachers.</div>

<p>God himselfe sent his faithfull seruants, the Prophets,
Apostles, Euangelists, and especially his onely begotten
sonne Christ Iesu our Lord and Sauiour into the worlde,
by whome he truly and plentifully taught his faithfull seruants
what they ought to bel&eacute;eue, to do, to leaue vndon, and
what kinde of worshipping did best please him, with many
other such things. By them he enformed vs concerning
great and waightie affaires, which should happen in his
Churche, and in kingdomes, euen vnto that blessed day
wherein Christ shall iudge the world, and shall call togither
his generall Councell, and shall pronounce finall
sentence vppon them who haue done well or ill, and
wherein he shall make a diuision and separation betw&eacute;ene
the good and euil.</p>

<p>Christ himselfe after his Resurrection did not immediately
ascend into heauen, but aboade a while on earth, appearing
vnto his Disciples and others, least we should at
any time say: Who euer came again to tell vs what estate
is to be looked for in the other world?</p>

<div class="sidenote">God hath preserued
the
scriptures.</div>

<p>Moreouer, God among suche great and long persecutions,
wherein many profitable bookes haue perished, hath
miraculously preserued the holy Scriptures for our profite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
euen vnto this day, and hereafter will preserue them
in despite of all impious and wicked men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God hath instituted
the
holy ministerie.</div>

<p>He hath also ordeyned the ministerie of the worde, that
vnto the ende of the worlde, there shoulde be some men,
whiche bothe by liuely voyce, and also by their writings,
shoulde interprete his worde, and enfourme others
of his will and pleasure. His woord is a shining
lanterne, which shineth in this darke worlde, which is

<span class="sidenote"><i>Psalme.</i>119.</span>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn</i>.8.</span>

full of errours, as we reade Psalm.119. And our sauiour
saith in the eight chapter of Saint <b>Iohn</b>, that he is the light
of the world, whome if any man follow, he walketh not in
darkenesse.</p>

<p>This standeth as a sure grounde: wherefore no other reuelations
are to be looked for, neither by myracles from
Heauen, nor by wandring spirites or soules, as the common
people misterme them. But lette vs imagine, that
they are the wandring spirites of deade bodies, then is it
necessarie, that they be the soules, either of faithfull men,
or of infidels. If they be the soules of the faithfull, they wil
say with God the father concerning his sonne Christe Iesus,
<b><i>Heare him</i></b>. But if they be the soules of Infidels and
of wicked men, who I pray you, will vouchsafe to heare
them, or bel&eacute;eue any thing they say? Moreouer those things
whiche these counterfeite soules doo speake, eyther agr&eacute;e
with the holy Scriptures, or else are contrary vnto them.
If they are agr&eacute;eable, then are they to be receiued, not because
spirits speake them, but because they are comprysed
in the word of God. But in case they are repugnant
to the woorde of God, they ought in no wise to be receiued,
albeit an Angell from Heauen vtter them. Thou wilt
not bel&eacute;eue a man of thy familiar acquaintaunce, otherwise
worthy of credite, who sounde of bodie and soule,
nowe liueth togither with th&eacute;e, if h&eacute;e affirme any thing
which thou knowest to be contrary to the holy Scriptures:
why them wouldest thou bel&eacute;eue a spirite which thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
doest not knowe? In ciuill causes the euidence or witnesse
or dead men is reiected, why then in causes of religion shuld
we giue care to the testimonie of runagate and wandring
spirites.</p>

<p>It is no harde or difficulte matter for the Lorde oure
God to sende his Angels vnto vs, whome otherwise h&eacute;e
vseth for our profite, and by them to instructe vs in the
faith: but it hath pleased him to appoint the matter otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Acts</i> .10.</div>

<p>W&eacute;e reade in the tenth chapter of the Actes, that by an
Angell he commaunded <b>Cornelius</b> to sende for <b>Peter</b>, that
he might instruct him in the faith. He mighte haue commaunded
the Angell to teache <b>Cornelius</b>, but he followed
an orderly meanes. It shal be best for vs therfore to stand
to the holy Scriptures simply, and that all appearing of
spirites, as also all dreames and reuelations be tried by
the holy Scriptures, as vpon a touchstone, and so to admit
nothing but that which is set foorth in the holy Scriptures:
for except we go thus warely to worke, there is greate
daunger least wee b&eacute;e deceiued. If the auncient Fathers
had so doone, they had not estrayed so farre from the Apostles
simplicitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Augustines
counsell.</div>

<p>S. <b>Augustine</b> in his third booke and .6. chapter, writing
againste the letters of <b>Petilianus</b> saieth thus: If concerning
Christe, or any other thing, whiche appartayneth to

<span class="sidenote">Scripture to

faith and euerlasting life, (I will not say, we: for comparing
with him that said: Albeit that w&eacute;e) but simply,
whereas he going on, sayd: If an Angell from Heauen
shall teache you any thing besides that whiche you haue
receiued in Scriptures conteining the law and the Gospel,
b&eacute;e he accursed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chrisostomes
aduise.</div>

<p>S. <b>Chrisostom</b> vnto the Epistle to the Galathians the
firste chapter: <b>Abraham</b> (saith he) when he was desired
to send Lazarus, said: They haue <b>Moises</b> and the prophets,
if they will not heare them, they will not giue care vnto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
them which rise vp from the dead. And when he bring in
Christ vttering these words, he sheweth howe he woulde
haue the holy scriptures more worthy of credite than any
raised from the dead. S. <b>Paule</b>
(when I name <b>Paule</b>, I name
likewise Christ, for he stirred vp his mind) preferreth the
Scriptures before Angels descending from Heauen, and
that for very iust cause. For albeit Angels are great, yet
are they seruants and ministers. For all holy scriptures
were not commaunded to be written and sent vnto vs by
seruants, but by almightie God y&#868; Lord of all things. Thus
write these two holy fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All things necessarie
to saluation
are c&#333;teined
in the
scriptures.</div>

<p>What things soeuer are necessarie for vs to know, are
conteined in the holy scriptures: those things which are not
expressed in them, we must not curiously enquire of, as
things profitable for our saluation. Who will therefore say
against the commaundement of God, that these things are
to be sought and learned of dead men, and by diuellish visions?
These things which are secret and hidden, we shall
throughly s&eacute;e when we come to eternall life. May not God,
if we be not content with his holy word, say that vnto vs,
which sometimes he spake by the mouth of <b>Helias</b> vnto the
messengers of king <b>Ochosias</b>. Is there no God in <b><i>Israell</i></b>,
that you now go to <b>Accaron</b> to aske counsell of Belzebub?
Yea <b>Thomas Aquinas</b> denieth that diuels are to be heard,
whiche deceiue simple menne, feyning themselues to be
the soules of dead men: and by that coloure especially terrifie
menne, whiche sometimes also happened vnto the
Gentiles.</p>

<p>If it were certaine and sure that the Diuell coulde
not appeare and deceiue menne, and also shewe greate
and straunge miracles, then perchaunce some men would
thinke that we shoulde giue care vnto such Spirites: but
nowe we s&eacute;e the contrary happen. An euill spirite cloaketh
his erroures vnder the coloure of diuine seruice, and
vnder the pretence of religi&#333;, he endeuoureth to ouerthrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote">Hierom.</span>

religion. For as S. <b>Hierome</b> saith, the diuell sheweth not
himselfe with all his deceits, that he may be knowne what
he is. And therefore it behoueth vs to be very circumspect
and warie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miracles are
seales of the
word.</div>

<p>Moreouer, miracles are onely testimonies and seales
of the word, neither may any thing be approued by them,
which is repugnant to the word of God. All miracles which
lead vs away from our Creator vnto creatures, and do attribute
that vnto our workes, which is onely due vnto the
merites of Christ: and to be short, all those which induce vs
any wayes into errour, are to be eschued. If we must n&eacute;eds
bel&eacute;eue these appearing soules, no man can be assured of
his estate: for new things should be continually deuised, as
we s&eacute;e plainly it happened in the olde time. Therefore we
must let passe all maner of spirits, and embrace true religion,
and therein constantly abide.</p>

<p>When Christ first sent abroad his Disciples to preach

<span class="sidenote"><i>Mat.</i>10.</span>

the Gospell, he said vnto them, <b>Matthew</b> 10. Be y&eacute;e wise as
Serpents, and simple as Doues, beware of men: howe
much more than ought we to take heede of diuels? Christ

<span class="sidenote"><i>Mat.</i>24.</span>

prophecieth in the 24. of <b>Matthew</b>, that many false teachers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
shall come in the latter daies, and shall shewe straunge
myracles to confirme their erroures, and therefore h&eacute;e
commaundeth the faithfull, to be h&eacute;edefull and circumspect,
and not without cause h&eacute;e addeth: Beholde I haue
tolde you before. Sainte <b>Paule</b> to the Galathians the
firste Chapter, saith in greate earnest vnto them, that if an
Angell come from Heauen, and preache vnto them any
other Gospell, h&eacute;e shoulde be accursed. Euen so, if at this
time spirites appeare, and doe vtter any thinge repugnant
to the Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, they

<span class="sidenote">1.<i>Tim.</i>4.</span>

are to be reiected. The Apostle in his firste Epistle and
fourth Chapter to Timothie, dothe prophecie of false teachers
whiche shoulde come, and saithe, the spirit speaketh
euidently, that in the latter times some shall departe from
the faithe, and shall giue h&eacute;ede vnto spirits of errour and
doctrines of Deuils, whiche speake lies through hipocrisie,
and haue their consciences burned with an hote yron,
forbidding to marrie, and commaunding to absteyne from
meates which God hath created to be receiued with gyuing
thankes of them whiche bel&eacute;eue, and knowe the
truth. &amp;c. By the worde (spirite) are vnderstoode false
teachers, whiche vaunt themselues of the spirite of God:
But what cause is there, why it may not be vnderstoode
of suche wandring spirites, which haue induced men to

<span class="sidenote">2.<i>Thess.</i>2.</span>

take in hande many things? In the seconde Epistle to the
Thessalonians, and the seconde Chapter, when certaine
affirmed the latter daye to be presente at hande, <b>Paule</b>
foretelleth them, that there shall be a defection, and that
Antichrist shall first come, saying: Nowe we bes&eacute;ech you
brethren by the comming of our Lorde Iesus Christe, by
our assembling vnto him, that y&eacute;e be not sodenly moued
from your intent, nor troubled, neither by spirits, nor by
word, nor by letter, as it were from vs, as though the day
of Christ were at hande. Let no man deceiue you by any
meanes. &amp;c. Whiche wordes truly in my iudgement may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
also be verie aptly vnderstood of those wandering spirites.

<span class="sidenote">1. <i>Iohn</i> .4.</span>

Saint <b>Iohn</b> saith in his first Epistle and fourth Chapter:
Dearly beloued, bel&eacute;eue not euery spirit, but trie the spirits
whether they are of God: for many false prophettes are
gone out into the world. Hereby shall ye knowe the spirit
of God. Euery spirit that confesseth that Iesus Christ is
come in the flesh, is of God, and euery spirite whiche confesseth
not, that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of
God. &amp;c. Here he speaketh not of spirites which falsly affirme
themselues to be mens soules, but of those teachers
whiche boaste of themselues that they haue the spirite of
God. But in case we must not beleeue them being aliue,
much lesse ought we to credite them when they are dead.
And albeit that neyther Christe nor his Apostles, had so
diligently giuen vs warning, not to suffer our selues to be
seduced with myracles, and with the talke of spirits, yet
notwithstanding, daily experience teacheth vs to bee circumspect
and warie in these cases. For assoone as false
teachers s&eacute;e that they haue no testimonie of Scripture to
defende themselues withall, by and by they turne themselues
to spirites and visions, whereby they may confirme
their doctrine, which thing hath opened a large windowe
to many errors. To what inconuenience ambition, couetousnesse
and enuie, hath brought many of the Clergie, it is
both well knowne by many examples, and it hath also as
it were by the way bene before declared. Haue not the
orders of Monkes striued amongest themselues for the
preheminence? haue not they inuented newe miracles?
haue they not counterfeited gods, pilgrimages, saintes

<span class="sidenote">The holy virgin did not by &amp; by beleeue the appearing of the Angell.</span>

that we shuld not rashly bel&eacute;eue euery spirit. For at
what time y&#868; Angell <b>Gabriel</b> appeared vnto her in a visible
shape, and saluted her, shewing her before of y&#868; incarnati&#333; of

s&eacute;eing sh&eacute;e had knowne no man. Then at the last being
enformed of the meanes by the Angell, she said: Beholde
the handmayd of the Lord, be it vnto me according to thy
word. Why then should we bel&eacute;eue euery spirite, especially
those which teach things quite contrary to the word
of God.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I Haue declared out of the word of God how good and godly
men ought to behaue themselues, when soeuer any
spirites appeare vnto them. And truly the auncient Christians
behaued themselues after this sort. For they were
couragious and without feare, they gaue themselues to
godlinesse, and all good workes, they diligently auoyded all
things which were displeasing vnto God: and they were
also very circumspect, not to attribute too much vnto spirits
and visions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The signe of

<p>It was a common custom amongst them, to blesse themselues
with the signe of the Crosse, when they mette with

<span class="sidenote">Tertullian.</span>

these things, which many also vse at this day. <b>Tertullian</b>
writeth in his booke <b><i>De corona militis</i></b>, that the auncient
Christians did many times marke their foreheades with

<span class="sidenote">Hierome.</span>

the signe of the Crosse. S. <b>Hierom</b> exhorteth <b>Demetriades</b>,
that he often crosse his foreheade, least that the destroyer

<span class="sidenote">Origen. &amp;c.</span>

of <b><i>Egipt</i></b> finde any place therein. <b>Origen</b> also, <b>Epiphanius</b>,
<b>Chrisostome</b>, and <b>Augustine</b>, write many thinges of the

vertue of the holie Crosse. S. <b>Athanasius</b> writeth in his
booke <b><i>De Humanitate verbi, eiusque corporali aduentu. Fol.67.</i></b>
In times past (saith he) the diuels by vaine shewes, and
mockerie, ensnared men, abiding somtimes in wels, sometime
in riuers, in stones, and woods, and so by craftie deceytes,
brought vnwise men into sottishnesse. But nowe

since Gods word hath appeared vnto vs, suche sightes and
vaine fantasies haue surceased. Fol. 56. and 72. and in other
places also he handleth the same matter.</p>

<p><b>Lactantius</b> writeth of the same in his fourth booke <b><i>Diuinarum
Institutionum</i></b> 26. Chapter, and also throughout the

those, nor any wayes hurt them, which signe their foreheads

externall signe of the Crosse, (for that were superstitious)
but vnto the Crosse, that is, to the merites of Christe,
whose worthinesse and excellencie, they called withall to
their remembrance. Touching the holy Apostles, or Apostolike
Churches, we reade not, that they euer vsed the
signe of the Crosse, in expelling diuels, in curing diseases,
or in any other thing. God spared the Iewes in <b><i>Egipt</i></b>,
whiche marked the doore postes with the bloude of the
Lambe: not that Lambes bloude is able to deliuer men
from death, but it was a figure of the bloud and passion of
Christ Iesus. And the Iewes sprinkled not bloud of their
owne good deuotion, as they terme it, but by the commandement
of God. The holy Fathers by the ceremonie that
they signed themselues with the Crosse, ment to testifie
their confidence in the crosse, that is, in the death of Christ
Iesus, which abandoneth all euill and mischiefe. The Diuell
neuer a whit feareth the Crosse, wherewith we signe
our selues, nor yet those pieces and fragments of Christes
Crosse, which are shewed for reliques, but he trembleth at
the power and force of Christs death, by the which he was
conquered and ouerthrowne. If any man attribute too much
vnto ceremonies, he cannot be excused from superstition,
which worthily deserueth blame.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coniurations
against diuels.</div>

<p>We read more in the auncient writers, that they vsed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
exorcismes, or coniurations in the primatiue Churche against
diuels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tertullian.</div>

<p>You may read in <b>Tertullian</b> in his booke <b><i>De anima</i></b>, that
vncleane spirits haue oftentimes deceiued men, haue taken
on them the persons of others, and haue fained themselues
to be the soules of dead men, that men should not bel&eacute;eue
that all soules descended into Hell (what is to be vnderstood
by the word Hell, I haue shewed before) and so to bring the
bel&eacute;efe of the latter iudgement of the resurrection of the
dead, into doubt and question.</p>

<p>Moreouer, we reade that the olde Fathers haue cast
diuels out of men, and out of such places wherein by their
rumbling, they haue put many in horrible feare. Such an
historie of Saint <b>Iohn</b> in <b>Abdias Babylonius</b>, for the holy
Apostles, and many godly men after them, were endued
with this grace from God, that they could cast out vnclean
spirits: which gift continued a long season in the Church,
to the great profit of the faithfull, but afterwards it ceased
as other miracles did also. It maketh vnto this purpose,
that <b>Tertullian</b> writeth in his <b>Apologetico</b>, <b>Fol.</b> 858.
and 159.</p>

<p>Thus we haue sufficiently s&eacute;ene after what sort the
holy Fathers and auncient christians behaued themselues
when any spirits appeared vnto them.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><b>That sundrie kindes of superstition haue crept in, whereby<br />
men haue attempted to driue away spirits.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN proces of time, superstitions encreased more &amp; more.

<span class="sidenote">2.<i>Thess.</i>2.</span>

<b>Paule</b> complaineth, that in his time Antichrist beganne
to practise his ministerie of iniquitie, that many opinions

<span class="sidenote">1.<i>Iohn</i>.4.</span>

and sects beganne to spring vp. Saint <b>Iohn</b> writeth,
that in his time, there were many Antichristes. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
maruel is it then, if afterwards, yea and that verie quickly,
diuers errours croape into the Churche, and multiplyed
exc&eacute;edingly?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Augustine.</div>

<p>Sainte <b>Augustine</b> in his 22. booke <b><i>De ciuitate Dei</i></b>,
and eighte Chapter, after that hee hadde recited certaine
miracles, whiche were therefore shewed that men might
bel&eacute;eue in Christ, he setteth foorthe this historie. <b>Hesperius</b>
a man of good worshippe and calling amongest vs, hath
a piece of land in the territorie of <b><i>Fussalum</i></b> called <b><i>Cubedi</i></b>,
in the which, perceiuing by the languishing of his cattell
and seruauntes, that his house was infected with the force
and rage of euill spirites, he desired our fellow Priestes,
(I being then absent,) that some one of them would take
the paines to go thither, that the spirit by his good praiers
might giue place: one of them went thither, and there offred
the sacrifice of the bodie of Christ, praying very earnestly,
that the same disquieting of spirites might cease,
and by and by God had compassion, and it ceased. He had
giuen him of a friend of his, some parte of holy lande
brought from Hierusalem, where Christ being buried,
rose againe the third day: that earth he hung vp in his
chamber, least any euill might happ&#275; vnto him. But when
his house was deliuered fr&#333; that trouble, he deuiseth with
himselfe what he might do with the saide earth, which for
reuerence sake, he would not k&eacute;epe any longer in his
chamber. &amp;c. H&eacute;ereby it is manifest, that superstition began
immediatly, and (as it hapneth alwaies) grewe bigger
with great increase, as if one shoulde roll foorthe snowe
clodded togither, or as when huge lumpes of snowe begin
to fall down from the <b><i>Alpes</i></b>, all things on euery side are filled
with snowe. Shortly after menne began to praye, and
offer sacrifice for dead mennes soules, yea and that with
a good intention, as it may euidently appeare in many of
the auncient fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards when Bishops and parish Priests, did not
onely not correct olde superstitions, but also vppon a good
meaning increase them, at the last they grew to an infinite
number. For when spirits appeared, men called not vpon
God through Christ only, but also vpon Saints, forgetting
that which S. <b>Paule</b> saith to the Romanes the tenth. (For
I wil let passe at this time all other arguments,) how shall
they call vpon him in whom they haue not bel&eacute;eued? The
Papists themselues cannot deny, but that we must bel&eacute;eue
onely in God, and therefore he onely is to be worshipped
through his sonne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aue Marie
is no praier.</div>

<p>Some write that it is a soueraign remedie to driue away
diuels, if we pray <b><i>Aue Maria</i></b>. Where by the way
is to bee noted, that the same salutation of the Angell is
no prayer, but onely a gr&eacute;eting, and historicall narration,
to witte, howe the Archangell <b>Gabriell</b> tolde the Virgin
<b>Mary</b> before of the Incarnation of Christ. But I pray
th&eacute;e weigh the sense of the words, and whether though wilt
or no, thou must n&eacute;edes say that these words conteine in
them neither asking, nor thankesgiuing, which are the
parts of prayer. When the Angell came vnto her, he saluted her, saying:

<span class="gktext">&chi;&alpha;&#8150;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;</span>,

 <b><i>i. salue</i></b>, that is, God sp&eacute;ede, or reioyce
(for as <b>Festus</b> saith, the Gr&eacute;eke and the Latin word
haue one signification.) Then he addeth further, full of
grace, which is to be vnderstood passiuely, as they terme
it in the schooles) for because God bestowed his grace vpon
her: for so the Angell himselfe expoundeth it, when he
saith afterwardes, that she had founde grace, that is, that
God is mercifull and louing towardes her. Those words
may not be so vnderstoode, as if she were the fountaine of
grace (as some haue expounded it) and that she hath grace
of her selfe, and bestoweth it vpon such as call vppon her,
or speake vnto her with the salutation of the Angell. For
neyther the Gr&eacute;eke worde, nor any other places of the
Scriptures admit this sense. The Apostle saieth to the

<span class="sidenote"><i>Ephe.</i>1.</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Ephesians the first Chapter, that God hath made vs his
faithfull seruants, deare by his grace through his beloued,
that is, through Iesus Christ. In the which saying, the
same word is put, which the Angell vsed in saluting the
holy Virgine. It is written in the first Chapter of saint

<span class="sidenote"><i>Iohn</i>.2.</span>

<b>Iohns</b> Gospell in plaine wordes, that <b>Iohn Baptist</b> bare
witnesse of Christ with a loude voyce, and saide, that we
all haue receiued of his fulnesse, grace for grace. For the
lawe was giuen by <b>Moses</b>, but grace and truth sprang vp
by Christ. Many other suche places I omit for breuities
sake. The Virgin <b>Mary</b> her selfe saith, the Lord hath done
maruellous things vnto me. She setteth foorth the grace
of God, giuen vnto her from God, without any of her deserts.
For he neuer bestowed greater grace on any woman.
And there is a very great difference betw&eacute;en him that conferreth
grace, and them which receiue or obtaine grace.
Grace is only to be sought at his hands, who giueth grace,
and not of them which themselues receiue grace. A fewe
yeares past, all men besought the Virgin for helpe, hoping
for more grace and succour of her than of Christ himselfe.
The Angell addeth further: Blessed art thou amongst women,
that is, God hath conferred more grace vnto th&eacute;e,
than vnto any other woman. The words which are ioyned
herevnto, Blessed is the frute of thy wombe, are not the
words of the Angell, but of her cousin <b>Elizabeth</b>, who also
saluted her. Vnto these words some religious men added,
Iesus Christ, Amen. Therefore the Angell vttered not all
those words of the <b>Aue Marie</b> (as it may manifestly be gathered
out of the very text of Saint <b>Luke</b>, Chapter 1.) not
because we deny these words to be good and holy, for the
text saith of <b>Elizabeth</b>, that she was full of the holy ghost:
but that which the Angell spake not, is not to be attributed
vnto her. You shall not finde in any allowed Authors, that
in the time of the Apostles and many dayes after, this greeting
was accounted as a prayer, or that any godly men did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
salute, and call vpon the holy Virgin. Which thing I write
not, because I would bereaue the holy Virgin of hir honor,
but least that against hir will, we giue hir that honour
which is only due to God the Father, and to his sonne Iesu

<span class="sidenote">1. <i>Timo.</i> 2.</span>

Christ. For he is our onely mediatour and red&eacute;emer. 1.
Timoth. 2. Otherwise the <b>Aue Marie</b>, and other such places
of holy Scripture full of consolation and comfort, touching
the humanitie of Christ, his punishment, death, and
merites, are to be often read, and diligentely considered:
neither are the Scriptures to be pulled out of the handes
of the lay people, in whiche they may s&eacute;e all these things
with their owne eyes. Ind&eacute;ede I denie not but Spirites
haue many times vanished away vpon the saying of <b>Aue
Marie</b>, but it was so doone, that men might therby be confirmed
in their superstition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Holy Water.</div>

<p>But these men proc&eacute;eding further, did coniure or consecrate
water with certain peculiar ceremonies, and kept
it in vessels in their churches, houses and elsewhere: amongest
many other vertues, ascribing this force vnto it,
that it chaseth away spirites, and vaine sights. They also
consecrated saulte, and taught, that whether soeuer it were
cast, it draue away spirites, and all deceites of the diuil, yea
and the diuel himselfe also. Moreouer, they coniured with
certain cerimonies and words, candles, palme, herbes, and
other creatures, to driue away fantasies (as they terme
them.) They laide these and such like things, as also the
relikes of Saintes, in those places wheras Spirits had bin
s&eacute;ene or heard. They also bare men in hande, that greate
belles and sancebelles by their noise fraied spirites out of
the ayre. All these things are founde more at large in the
Papists bookes whiche are written of the consecration of
suche things, and are publikely extant. If belles be roong
on S. <b>Iohns</b> day, or
S. <b>Agathes</b> day, they say it is a most
excell&#275;t remedie against spirits. Some vsed to burne a bundell
of consecrated herbes, that with the smoke therof they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
might chase away diuels. Many haue their peculiar and
straunge blessings against spirites. There haue bene also
many holy rites instituted by the commaundement of wandring
soules, as Masses for the dead, vigils, prayers, and
tweluemonths minds: as though the soules of godly men,
being deliuered from all trouble, were not immediately
translated into eternall rest. And it is also plaine by reading
the Poets and Historiographers, that the Gentiles had
their sacrifices for the dead, as their rites called <b>Nouendialia</b>,
which were obserued the ninth day, and their yearely
feastes. &amp;c. Howbeit those counterfait ghostes craued nothing
so earnestly, as that many Masses might be sung for
their sakes, for they bare men in hand, that those had great
and maruellous force to red&eacute;eme them out of Purgatorie.</p>

<p><b>Iohn Tritenhemius</b> writeth in his Cronicles of the
Monasterie of <b>Hirsgauium</b>, about the yeare of our Lorde
1098. <b>Henricus</b> the fourth then being Emperour, that at

<span class="sidenote">The order of Cistertians.</span>

such time as the order of the <b>Cistertians</b> first began, there
appeared many dayes and nights, not far from the citie of <b><i>Wormes</i></b>,
great troupes of horsmen and footmen, as if they
were now going foorth to battail, running now here &amp; now
there in troupes, and that about .ix. of the clock at night they
returned again to the hill nere at hand, out of y&#868; which they
vsed to come forth. At last a certaine Monke of the Abbey of <b><i>Limpurge</i></b>,
which stood not far from y&#868; hil whence they issued,
associating certain other vnto him, came on a certain night
to y&#868; place of the hil, &amp; blessing himselfe with y&#868; signe of y&#868; holy
Crosse, adiured them in the name of the holy and vnseparable
Trinitie, as they came out of the hil, to declare vnto
him who they were: vnto whom one of the company made
answer: we are (quoth he) no vain things, neither yet liuing
souldiers, but y&#868; soules of earthly men, seruing in this world
vnder our prince, who not l&#333;g since was slain in this place.
The armour, furniture, &amp; horses, which were vnto vs instruments
of sinne while we liued, are euen now after our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
death, certaine signes and tokens of tormentes. Whatsoeuer
ye s&eacute;e about vs, is all firie vnto vs, although you nothing
discerne our fire. When the Monkes enquired whether
they might be holpen by men, the spirit answered: we
may (saith he) be holpen by fasting and praiers: but chiefly
by the oblation of the bodie and blood of Christ, which thing
we bes&eacute;ech you do for vs. Assoone as he had so saide, all the
whole rout of spirits cried thr&eacute;e times with one voyce: pray
for vs, pray for vs, pray for vs. And sodeinly withal, they s&eacute;emed
to be all resolued into fire, yea and the hill it self, as if
it had bin on fire, cast forth as it were a great crashing and
rushing of tr&eacute;es. They had in Churches a peculiar order of

<span class="sidenote">Exorcists.</span>

them whom they called <b>Exorcists</b>, or Coniurers, whose dutie
was to coniure and driue away diuels, but they were
not so endued with that gifte, as the auncient Christians
were, and therfore they did but vaunt &amp; boast of themselues.</p>

<p>Afterwards certaine Monkes and Priests well s&eacute;en in
Magicall sciences (for they were neuer without such trim
men) tooke vpon them to coniure and driue away euill spirits
out of houses into woods &amp; desart places. They wroght
maruellous and straunge things, and they said that a spirit
in the name of Saints, and by the vertue of their coniuring
and characters, was constrained to giue place whether he
would or not. Ind&eacute;ede the diuel giueth place, but he doth
it as enemies doo, which by flying chuse a more fit place
to fight in, or more apte to embushe themselues. That
which Sathan doth, he doth it willingly and of his owne
accorde, that he might withdrawe men from trusting in
God onely, and driue them headlong into Idolatrie. Christ
and his Disciples cast out diuels, but they were loth and
vnwilling to depart. Moreouer they vsed to hang Saint
<b>Iohns</b> Gospell about their neckes, and carried about with
them hallowed waxe inclosed in a purse, which they call
an <b><i>Agnus Dei</i></b>, There are certaine bookes abroade, especially
one written by <b>Iacobus de Clusa</b>, a Carthusian, concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the appearing of soules separated from their bodies,
wherein amongst other things we reade, after what
sort men should prepare themselues, when any spirits appeare,
howe they shall behaue themselues in comming to
them, in departing from them, in the place where they appeare,
and what questions are to be proposed vnto them:
touching which things I spake before, in the second part of
this Booke and second Chapter, where if you list you may
finde them.</p>

<p>I haue heard men which haue confessed themselues to
haue bene so superstitious, that when the priest lifted vp
the host (as they call it) in saying masse, they woulde presently
wipe their face with their hands, because they were
perswaded, that it was good to stop all spirits from m&eacute;eting
with them in a visible forme.</p>

<p>But tell m&eacute;e I pray th&eacute;e whosoeuer thou art whiche
doest so, by what places of Scripture canst thou confirme
those ceremonies? Where doth Christ and his Disciples
teach vs to expell the diuell (which is a spirit, and therefore
without any bodie) by bodily things? shewe but one example,
that they haue cast forth the diuel by this way or means.
If you bring out of the bookes of <b>Tobie</b>, that the heart and
liuer of the fish being laide on the coales, droue away the
diuel with the smell, we say that the same booke is not accounted
amongst the Canonicall scriptures: and moreouer
that the same diuel was rather vanquished by the praiers
of <b>Tobias</b> and his wife, than by any fumigation. Did Christ
ordaine the holy Supper to this ende, that thereby diuels
should be cast out? Albeit that an euil spirit doo faine to giue
place, because of these things, yet he bringeth to passe in
the meane season, that superstition is more d&eacute;eply rooted in
the hearts of men.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>That spirites are not to bee driuen away by cursing and<br />
banning.</b></p>

<p class="drop-cap">HEre I cannot ouerpasse, that certaine doo vainly persuade
themselues, that spirites may easily be driuen
away with cursing and banning, for that (as they say)
spirits approach neare vnto such as pray, and do more egerly
disturbe and vex them. Our Lord Iesus Christ who can
best tell how we should fight against the craft and subtiltie
of the diuel, teacheth vs in many places to pray continually,
he biddeth vs to pray in y&#868; Lords praier, that we may be
deliuered from euil, calling Sathan by the figure
<span class="gktext">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#940; &#7953;&zeta;&omicron;&chi;&#8053;&nu;</span>,
Euil it selfe, because he excelleth therein. Nothing can be
more acceptable and pleasing to the diuel, than when any
man vseth cursing and banning. He feineth that he is hereby
driuen away, but in the meane season he cr&eacute;epeth inuisibly
into their bosomes. If you list ye may driue away the
diuel, in saying that he hath no place with you, but his place
is in Hell, and that he hath nothing to do with those which
put their only trust and confidence in Christ Iesus. For in

<span class="sidenote"><i>Rom.</i> 8.</span>

the eight Chapter to the Romanes in the beginning, it is
said: Now there is no condemnation vnto them, that are
grafted in Christ Iesu, who walke not according to the
flesh, but according to the spirit. A man may commaund the
diuel to depart from him without any cursing or banning.
And that is also to be blamed, that certaine wicked and rash
men talke very beastly, and filthily with spirits, if they appeare
at any time vnto them.</p>

<p>Some others, when spirits appeare vnto them, will by
and by set on them, and driue th&#275; away with naked swords:
and sometimes throw them out of the windowes, not considering
with themselues, that spirites are nothing hurt
with weapons. In the Grecian histories we reade, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
certaine <b><i>Lacedemonian</i></b> passing by a sepulchre in the night
season, when a spirit s&eacute;emed to appeare vnto him, ranne towards
it thinking to run it through with his speare: saying:
Whither fliest thou, O thou soule which shalt twice
die? Surely it is praise worthie when a men m&eacute;eting with
a spirit is not afraid, but yet boldnesse and rashnesse cannot
be commended. If thy enemy, albeit he be very weake be
not to be despised, much lesse ought an enemy so mightie
and so craftie, to be neglected. There haue bene some who
when they would haue striken a spirit with their sworde,
haue thought they haue striken the featherbed, the diuel so
mocked them. Others supposing they had throwne a spirit
out of the window, by and by thought they heard shingles
falling and ratling amongst the tr&eacute;es.</p>

<p>It is reported that there haue bin some, who supposing
with their weapons to hurt spirits, haue wounded themselues,
for their armes and other members of their bodie
haue neuer serued them after. We must not vse a materiall
sword against spirits and vaine shewes (for it profiteth nothing)
but we must vse the sword of the spirit. They which
will strike spirits and ghosts with a sword, ind&eacute;ed
<span class="gktext">&#963;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;</span>,
that is, fight with their owne shadow. In the booke of <b>Iobe</b>
the diuel is signified by <b>Leuiathan</b>, which careth not for the
speare, for he appeareth in diuers shapes, and cannot be put
to flight with pikes. The diuel is a spirit, he hath not bones
and flesh, but he only taketh on him a shape for a time. But
in case spirits which haue bodies do wander (that is, coniurers,
priests, whores, &amp; whoremongers, which faine themselues
to be spirites) there can be no better coniuration inuented,
than to bang them well with a cudgell. For thou
shalt not so much preuaile with these kindes of diuels with
words as with stripes.</p>

<p>Hitherto I haue shewed howe they ought to behaue
themselues which m&eacute;ete with spirits. As touching them
which neuer heard or sawe any thing (for there bee many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
which neuer chaunced on such things) let them be thankful
vnto God for so great a benefit, let them not be rashe and
bolde, nor desirous to s&eacute;e such things, but rather let them
pray vnto God for them which are vexed with such euils.
Let them not doo, as they many times vse which were neuer
greatly sicke: for they f&eacute;ele not other mens griefes, and
therefore they thinke they are litle sicke, or that they counterfeit
their sicknesse, vntill such time as they themselues
fall into some great and daungerous disease: euen so God
can cause them to s&eacute;e spirites, which neuer sawe any before,
that afterwards they may be the more touched with other
mens griefes, and diligently pray for them.</p>

For writing of <b>Alexander</b> the great, in his booke <b><i>De
vitis</i></b>, he saith; that there happened certaine prognostications
before his death, which sometimes <b>Alexander</b> cared
not for, but contemned them, and contrariwise, sometimes
he tooke smal and trifling things, as signes of euil lucke.</p>

<p>He addeth further, how dangerous a thing it is, to despise
tokens and signes sent from God vnto men, and on
the other side, how pernitious and hurtfull it is to be afraid
of euery trifle, for as in all other things, so is there a measure
to be obserued herein. The same opinion is he of, touching
other wonders and miracles. For ye may reade in
the life of <b>Camillus</b>, that when he being Captain, had taken
and destroyed the <b><i>Veians</i></b>, he made a solemne vow, to translate
the Image of <b>Iuno</b> vnto <b><i>Rome</i></b>. And therefore he commaunded
certain men to take vp the Image: he offered sacrifice
vnto the Goddesse, and besought her that she would
vouchsafe to follow him, and to be fauourable vnto the Romanes,
as other Goddes were which now dwelt at <b><i>Rome</i></b>.
The Image made him answere that she would goe with
him. He also writeth, that those men which noted and recorded
these things, report other such straunge matters, as
that Images did sweate, that they gaue great grones, that
they turned away their faces, or hanged down their heads:
he saieth, that men whiche liued before his time, gathered
many suche examples togither, and that he himselfe hath
heard many maruellous things of men liuing in his time,
which were not by and by to be neglected and contemned:
and yet mans infirmitie is such, that it cannot attribute either
too much or too little, vnto those things without great
daunger, for men obserue no measure, but are either too superstitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and attribute ouer much to such matters, or else
do vtterly reiect and contemne them. And therefore the safest
way is, to be aduised, and to k&eacute;epe a meane in suche affaires.

<span class="sidenote">Valerius
Maximus.</span>

<b>Valerius Maximus</b> confesseth in his first booke, that
the very Gentils themselues had many miracles and wonders
happening among them in great suspition, and that
not without iust cause. True wonders ought to stir vs vp
from sl&eacute;epe. A couragious horse goeth well inough of his
owne accorde, and yet if you do but make signe vnto him
with a wande, or put spurre vnto him, he will be more readier
and quicker. Euen so must we go in the way that leadeth
vnto heauen so long as we liue, but in case we s&eacute;e any
foretokens, or some great alteration s&eacute;eme to hang ouer vs,
we ought to bee the more stirred vp, to giue our selues to
praier, and to exercise godlinesse. The Gentiles if at any
time such forewarnings were shewed vnto them from heauen,
did institute certaine solemne praiers and processions
to pacifie their Gods: how much rather ought all Christian
Princes and Magistrates, Doctors and Preachers of
our time, to bend themselues wholly herein, when so euer
plagues hang ouer our heads, that all men generally and
particularly shewe forth true repentance?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conclusion.</div>

<p>Hitherto (I trust) we haue sufficiently shewed what we
may thinke, concerning visions and appearing of spirites,
and other straunge things which haue great affinitie and
likenesse vnto them. And that in times past, Doctors wrote
and taught farre otherwise concerning them, than the very
truth it selfe was, we haue also shewed the causes thereof.
It might be also declared in many words, that the like
hath happened in other pointes of Christian doctrine, yea
and many excellent learned and godly men, haue at large
opened the same in their bookes which are now extant concerning
such matters.</p>

<p>And that I may conclude this my booke, I shall bes&eacute;ech
all those, for the glorie of God, that shall happen to reade it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that in case they thinke I haue straied from the rule of the
word of God, they would fr&eacute;ely and friendly admonish me
thereof, but if they know it be agr&eacute;eable to the word of God
(as I trust it is) that then they suffer not themselues to be
ruled and mocked of iugling Monkes and Priests, but rather
giue God thankes for that great and vnspeakable benefit,
whereby he doth daily deliuer them out of great errors
and feares, and doth continually more and more bring
his truth to light: let them not so lose the raignes to their
affections, that they reiect the truth which they haue once
acknowledged.</p>

<p>The Senat and people of <b><i>Rome</i></b> as stories witnesse, granted
libertie to the people of <b><i>Cappadocia</i></b>, when the stocke and
issue of their kings was vtterly extinct, to be fr&eacute;e, and Lords
of themselues for euer after. But the Nobilitie consulting
on the matter, refusing libertie which they coulde in
no wise disgest, desired to haue a King. The Romaines
wondring h&eacute;ereat, gaue them leaue to choose whome they
would to be their King. Let not vs b&eacute;e such fooles, but
rather let vs imbrace the libertie of our soules, whiche
God doth daily offer vnto vs by his word.</p>

<p>Many Noble nations fighting couragiously, haue put
themselues in present daunger of life, to obtaine and k&eacute;epe
this sw&eacute;ete eternall libertie. How muche more ought
the Christians to fight against the subtiltie and deceit of
the Deuill, least the libertie of our soules, whiche is much
more precious than the other, shoulde be opressed by diuers
errors and supersticions.</p>

<p>Men sitting in darkenesse, desire the light very earnestly.
Let not vs therefore cast away light fr&eacute;ely offered
vnto vs by God in this Scriptures. We haue nothing
here in earth more deare vnto vs, than the libertie of our
soules and consciences. Let vs not then (as <b>Paule</b> saith,)
withhold truth in vnrighteousnesse, let euery man of what
age soeuer he be, weigh with himself how fraile and brittle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
this life is whiche God hath giuen vnto vs, and that wee
must depart from hence, sooner then we thinke for, and render
an account to the iust Iudge, of our faith, wordes, and
d&eacute;eds.</p>

<p class="center">Glorie and praise be vnto Almightie God for euer and<br />
euer, and I bes&eacute;ech him to vouchsafe to stretch foorth his<br />
hande, to deliuer all suche as are still entangled in<br />
superstition and errours, and to graunt those<br />
whome he hath deliuered his heauenly<br />

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
